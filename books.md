I constantly get emails from various people asking me what books I have read to learn what I have learnt,
or what books I suggest they read. So, instead of emailing everyone the list, I will enlist the books
that I have read up until this point (in no particular order), in the hope that other people interested in Unix, 
compilers, and computer science in general find them more easily.
