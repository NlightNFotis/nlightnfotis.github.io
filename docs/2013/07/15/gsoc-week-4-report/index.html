  <title>GSOC: Week 4 report</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Yeah baby! It builds! The highlight of this week’s progress was managing to successfully build gccgo under the Hurd. Not only did it compile successfully, it also run its tests, with the results matching the ones provided by my mentor Thomas Schwinge. This was a checkpoint in my summer of code project. Successful building of the compiler meant that I am (happily) in the position to carry on with the next part (and the main one) of my project, that is, to make sure that the go library (libgo) also passes all its tests and works without any major issues. So where are we now? gccgo Compiling gccgo on the Hurd was big. But we also had to see how it compared to the build that was successful on Linux. The most effective way to compare the two builds, is to check the test results of the two. Taking a look at the gccgo results on the Hurd, I was delighted to find that it passed most of its tests. There were few that were failing, but for the most part, it did well. Below are the test results of gccgo on the Hurd: === go Summary === # of expected passes 5069 # of unexpected failures 11 # of expected failures 1 # of untested testcases 6 /root/gcc_new/gccbuild/gcc/testsuite/go/../../gccgo version 4.9.0 20130606 (experimental) (GCC) So it’s passing 99% of its tests. That’s cool. But it could help to take a look at the tests that are failing, to get an idea of what the fails are, how critical they are, etc nlightnfotis@earth:~/HurdVM/HurdFiles$ grep -v ^PASS: &amp;lt; go.sum Test Run By root on Thu Jul 11 10:33:34 2013 Native configuration is i686-unknown-gnu0.3 === go tests === Schedule of variations: unix Running target unix Running /root/gcc_new/gcc/gcc/testsuite/go.dg/dg.exp ...

So these are the failing tests. Before we go through them, it might be a good idea to check the status of the gccgo tests on the Linux build too. Let’s see. nlightnfotis@earth:~$ grep -v ^PASS: &amp;lt; linux_go.sum Test Run By fotis on Mon Jul 15 10:28:38 2013 Native configuration is i686-pc-linux-gnu === go tests === Schedule of variations: unix Running target unix Running /home/fotis/Software/gcc/gcc/testsuite/go.dg/dg.exp ...

But wait a minute. Those tests that are failing. They are the same as with the Hurd build. So I can assume that we are left with 4 less tests to check regarding their failures (Go on Linux works without any issues,so I guess it would be safe to skip those tests at the moment). That leaves us with these tests to check: FAIL: go.test/test/chan/doubleselect.go execution, -O2 -g FAIL: go.test/test/chan/nonblock.go execution, -O2 -g UNTESTED: go.test/test/chan/select2.go FAIL: go.test/test/chan/select3.go execution, -O2 -g FAIL: go.test/test/chan/select5.go execution FAIL: go.test/test/fixedbugs/bug147.go execution, -O2 -g FAIL: go.test/test/fixedbugs/bug347.go execution, -O0 -g FAIL: go.test/test/fixedbugs/bug348.go execution, -O0 -g FAIL: go.test/test/goprint.go execution UNTESTED: go.test/test/goprint.go compare FAIL: go.test/test/mallocfin.go execution, -O2 -g FAIL: go.test/test/nil.go execution, -O2 -g FAIL: go.test/test/recover3.go execution, -O2 -g UNTESTED: go.test/test/stack.go Discussing this with my mentor Thomas Schwinge in IRC (#hurd) For now, please ignore any failing tests that have »select« in their name -- that is, do file them, but do not spend a lot of time figuring out what might be wrong there. The Hurd&#39;s select implementation is a bit of a beast, and I don&#39;t want you -- at this time -- spend a lot of time on that. We already know there are some deficiencies, so we should postpone that to later. So that leaves us with even less tests to check: FAIL: go.test/test/chan/nonblock.go execution, -O2 -g FAIL: go.test/test/fixedbugs/bug147.go execution, -O2 -g FAIL: go.test/test/fixedbugs/bug347.go execution, -O0 -g FAIL: go.test/test/fixedbugs/bug348.go execution, -O0 -g FAIL: go.test/test/goprint.go execution UNTESTED: go.test/test/goprint.go compare FAIL: go.test/test/mallocfin.go execution, -O2 -g FAIL: go.test/test/nil.go execution, -O2 -g FAIL: go.test/test/recover3.go execution, -O2 -g UNTESTED: go.test/test/stack.go Nice. This narrowed down the list of errors that I have to go through to make sure that gccgo works as well on the Hurd as it does on Linux. libgo So, we talked about gccgo, but what about the runtime libraries (libgo)? They are also getting tested when we run make check-goand seeing as they are a vital part of enabling programs written on go to run on the Hurd, we ought to take a look. (This was also the original goal of my project proposal). So let us see what we have at the libgo.sum: Test Run By root on Fri Jul 12 17:56:44 UTC 2013 Native configuration is i686-unknown-gnu0.3 === libgo tests === Schedule of variations: unix Running target unix Running ../../../gcc/libgo/libgo.exp ...

Oh boy! Well, on second thoughts, this was not unexpected. This was the core of my GSOC work. This is how it starts :) Before this goes any further, maybe we should visit the Linux test results too.

PASS: bufio PASS: bytes ... === libgo Summary === # of expected passes 131 /home/fotis/Software/gcc_build/./gcc/gccgo version 4.9.0 20130702 (experimental) (GCC) Wow. Considering the results from the Hurd, they really are not unexpected. Remember that getcontext, makecontext, setcontext and swapcontext are not working as expected. And recalling from an email from Ian Lance Taylor (the GCCgo maintainer, and a member of the Go team) early in the summer: Go does require switching stacks. A port of Go that doesn’t support goroutines would be useless–nothing in the standard library would work Conclusion / Work for next week. So now it comes down to work on implementing correctly the context switching functions. Apart from that, going through the test results that fail from gccgo is also something that is to be done, however I am not sure that it should be a first priority. I also have to go through go.log to see if there any clues as to why the gccgo tests fail. Having finally built gccgo on the Hurd, and more importantly still being on schedule, (the original one, from my proposal) means that I can now concentrate on the core part of my project proposal (and the most exciting one too), that is proper implementation of what is blocking effective context switching, which in its part is blocking goroutines, without which, the go library will not work properly.">

    <h1>Yeah baby! It builds!</h1>

<p><strong>The highlight of this week’s progress was managing to successfully build
gccgo under the Hurd.</strong>
Not only did it compile successfully, it also run its tests, with the
results <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2013-06/msg00117.html">matching the ones provided by my mentor Thomas Schwinge</a>.
This was a checkpoint in my summer of code project. Successful building of
the compiler meant that I am (happily) in the position to carry on with the
next part (and the main one) of my project, that is, to make sure that
the <strong>go library (libgo) also passes all its tests 
and works without any major issues.</strong></p>

<h1>So where are we now?</h1>

<h2>gccgo</h2>

<p>Compiling gccgo on the Hurd was big. But we also had to see how it 
compared to the build that was successful on Linux. The most effective
way to compare the two builds, is to check the test results of the two.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the gccgo results on the Hurd, I was delighted to find 
that it passed most of its tests. There were few that were failing, but 
for the most part, it did well. Below are the test results of gccgo on the Hurd:</p>

<div lang="shell" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     === go Summary ===

# of expected passes        5069
# of unexpected failures    11

# of untested testcases     6
/root/gcc_new/gccbuild/gcc/testsuite/go/../../gccgo  version 4.9.0 20130606 (experimental) (GCC)

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So it’s passing 99% of its tests. That’s cool. But it could help to take a look
at the tests that are failing, to get an idea of what the fails are, how critical they are, etc</p>

<p>Hmm. So these are the failing tests. Before we go through them, it might be a good idea
to check the status of the gccgo tests on the Linux build too. Let’s see.</p>

<p>So, it seems like there are less tests failing here. But wait a minute. Those tests that are failing.
They are the same as with the Hurd build. So I can assume that we are left with 4 less tests to check
regarding their failures (Go on Linux works without any issues,so I guess it would be safe to skip those tests at the moment).
That leaves us with these tests to check:</p>

<p>Discussing this with my mentor <a href="https://plus.google.com/101468009864620818344">Thomas Schwinge</a> in IRC (#hurd)</p>

<blockquote>
  <tschwinge> For now, please ignore any failing tests that have »select« in their name -- that is, do file them, but do not spend a lot of time figuring out what might be wrong there.
<tschwinge> The Hurd's select implementation is a bit of a beast, and I don't want you -- at this time -- spend a lot of time on that.  We already know there are some deficiencies, so we should postpone that to later.
</tschwinge></tschwinge>
</blockquote>

<p>So that leaves us with even less tests to check:</p>

<div lang="shell" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>FAIL: go.test/test/chan/nonblock.go execution,  -O2 -g

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice. <strong>This narrowed down the list of errors that I have to go through to make sure that gccgo
works as well on the Hurd as it does on Linux.</strong></p>

<h2>libgo</h2>

<p>So, we talked about gccgo, but what about the runtime libraries (libgo)? They are also getting 
tested when we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make check-go</code>and seeing as they are a vital part 
of enabling programs written on go to run on the Hurd, we ought
to take a look. (This was also the original goal of my project proposal).</p>

<p>So let us see what we have at the libgo.sum:</p>

<p>Wow. Considering the results from the Hurd, they really are <strong>not</strong> unexpected. <a href="http://darnassus.sceen.net/~hurd-web/open_issues/gccgo/">Remember
that <strong>getcontext, makecontext, setcontext and swapcontext</strong> are not working as expected.</a></p>

<p>And recalling from an email from Ian Lance Taylor (the GCCgo maintainer, and a member of the Go team)
early in the summer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go does require switching stacks.  A port of Go that doesn’t support
goroutines would be useless–nothing in the standard library would
work</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Conclusion / Work for next week.</h1>

<p><strong>So now it comes down to work on implementing correctly the context switching functions.</strong> 
Apart from that, going through the test results that fail from gccgo is also something that
is to be done, however I am not sure that it should be a first priority. I also have to go
through go.log to see if there any clues as to why the gccgo tests fail.</p>

<p>Having finally built gccgo on the Hurd, and <strong>more importantly still being on schedule,
(the original one, from my proposal) means that I can now concentrate on the core part of my 
project proposal (and the most exciting one too)</strong>, that is proper implementation 
of what is <em>blocking effective context switching, which
in its part is blocking goroutines, without which, the go library will not work properly.</em></p>
