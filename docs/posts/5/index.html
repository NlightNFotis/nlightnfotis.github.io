          <h1>Yeah baby! It builds!</h1>

<p><strong>The highlight of this week’s progress was managing to successfully build
gccgo under the Hurd.</strong>
Not only did it compile successfully, it also run its tests, with the
results <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2013-06/msg00117.html">matching the ones provided by my mentor Thomas Schwinge</a>.
This was a checkpoint in my summer of code project. Successful building of
the compiler meant that I am (happily) in the position to carry on with the
next part (and the main one) of my project, that is, to make sure that
the <strong>go library (libgo) also passes all its tests 
and works without any major issues.</strong></p>

<h1>So where are we now?</h1>

<h2>gccgo</h2>

<p>Compiling gccgo on the Hurd was big. But we also had to see how it 
compared to the build that was successful on Linux. The most effective
way to compare the two builds, is to check the test results of the two.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the gccgo results on the Hurd, I was delighted to find 
that it passed most of its tests. There were few that were failing, but 
for the most part, it did well. Below are the test results of gccgo on the Hurd:</p>

<div lang="shell" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>     === go Summary ===

# of expected passes        5069
# of unexpected failures    11
# of expected failures      1
# of untested testcases     6
/root/gcc_new/gccbuild/gcc/testsuite/go/../../gccgo  version 4.9.0 20130606 (experimental) (GCC)

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So it’s passing 99% of its tests. That’s cool. But it could help to take a look
at the tests that are failing, to get an idea of what the fails are, how critical they are, etc</p>

<p>Hmm. So these are the failing tests. Before we go through them, it might be a good idea
to check the status of the gccgo tests on the Linux build too. Let’s see.</p>

<p>So, it seems like there are less tests failing here. But wait a minute. Those tests that are failing.
They are the same as with the Hurd build. So I can assume that we are left with 4 less tests to check
regarding their failures (Go on Linux works without any issues,so I guess it would be safe to skip those tests at the moment).
That leaves us with these tests to check:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Discussing this with my mentor <a href="https://plus.google.com/101468009864620818344">Thomas Schwinge</a> in IRC (#hurd)</p>

<blockquote>
  <tschwinge> For now, please ignore any failing tests that have »select« in their name -- that is, do file them, but do not spend a lot of time figuring out what might be wrong there.
<tschwinge> The Hurd's select implementation is a bit of a beast, and I don't want you -- at this time -- spend a lot of time on that.  We already know there are some deficiencies, so we should postpone that to later.
</tschwinge></tschwinge>
</blockquote>

<p>So that leaves us with even less tests to check:</p>

<div lang="shell" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>FAIL: go.test/test/chan/nonblock.go execution,  -O2 -g
FAIL: go.test/test/fixedbugs/bug147.go execution,  -O2 -g
FAIL: go.test/test/fixedbugs/bug347.go execution,  -O0 -g
FAIL: go.test/test/fixedbugs/bug348.go execution,  -O0 -g
FAIL: go.test/test/goprint.go execution

FAIL: go.test/test/nil.go execution,  -O2 -g
FAIL: go.test/test/recover3.go execution,  -O2 -g
UNTESTED: go.test/test/stack.go
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice. <strong>This narrowed down the list of errors that I have to go through to make sure that gccgo
works as well on the Hurd as it does on Linux.</strong></p>

<h2>libgo</h2>

<p>So, we talked about gccgo, but what about the runtime libraries (libgo)? They are also getting 
tested when we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make check-go</code>and seeing as they are a vital part 
of enabling programs written on go to run on the Hurd, we ought
to take a look. (This was also the original goal of my project proposal).</p>

<p>So let us see what we have at the libgo.sum:</p>

<p><strong>Oh boy!</strong> Oh boy! Well, on second thoughts, this was not unexpected. 
<strong>This was the core of my GSOC work</strong>. This is how it starts :)</p>

<p>Before this goes any further, maybe we should visit the Linux test results too.</p>

<p>Wow. Considering the results from the Hurd, they really are <strong>not</strong> unexpected. <a href="http://darnassus.sceen.net/~hurd-web/open_issues/gccgo/">Remember
that <strong>getcontext, makecontext, setcontext and swapcontext</strong> are not working as expected.</a></p>

<p>And recalling from an email from Ian Lance Taylor (the GCCgo maintainer, and a member of the Go team)
early in the summer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go does require switching stacks.  A port of Go that doesn’t support
goroutines would be useless–nothing in the standard library would
work</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Conclusion / Work for next week.</h1>

<p><strong>So now it comes down to work on implementing correctly the context switching functions.</strong> 
Apart from that, going through the test results that fail from gccgo is also something that
is to be done, however I am not sure that it should be a first priority. I also have to go
through go.log to see if there any clues as to why the gccgo tests fail.</p>

<p>Having finally built gccgo on the Hurd, and <strong>more importantly still being on schedule,
(the original one, from my proposal) means that I can now concentrate on the core part of my 
project proposal (and the most exciting one too)</strong>, that is proper implementation 
of what is <em>blocking effective context switching, which
in its part is blocking goroutines, without which, the go library will not work properly.</em></p>

          <h1>A new beginning</h1>

<p>Oh boy! A new start. Isn’t that exciting? You bet it is. It’s not however
my first introduction to blogging. I used to have a <a href="http://lambdareflection.wordpress.com">blog</a>
on Wordpress.com, but after a while I was turned off by the fact that it felt too limited.
So I decided I wanted a new place for me to host my online presence, that wasn’t so much limited as Wordpress was.
Initially I was thinking about renting a VPS and self hosting wordpress there. But after doing a little research,
I came across <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. I started investigating 
Github pages some more, and found <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> to be very <strong>very</strong> interesting.
After a while, I also came across <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. That was it. I was sold :)</p>

<p>Free hosting of a blog, no need to maintain a server, and a platform written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">ruby</a>?</p>

<p>Without hesitation, I immediately started working on it. I went through octopress documentation, (which needless to say, but it was fantastic)
found a wonderful theme online at <a href="http://opthemes.com">opthemes</a>, (kudos to <a href="http://alexgaribay.com">Alex Garibay</a> for that)
and got started.</p>

<p>And here we are. On a platform that you can hack and customize to your liking - at least more so than the locked down version of wordpress.
On a platform that is written on a language that I don’t hate with passion (like cough, <strong>php</strong>, cough), 
and may actually learn in the future, just for the sake of being able to customize every bit of it (gotta love the hacker’s way)</p>
<ul>
  <li>even though I am not really interested in web development per se.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope it starts out nice. I guess that is left to be seen.</p>
