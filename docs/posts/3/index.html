<h1>Hello world. Again.</h1>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span>
<span class="kt">int</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="n">printf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello world!</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Every user space (read: application) programmer, has written a hello world program. 
Only god knows how many times this program has been written. Yet, 
most programmers’ knowledge of the program is limited to something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>It sends the string passed as a parameter to the system to print.</li>
    <li>It takes the printf function from stdio.h and prints the string</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>and various other things, which are anywhere between plain wrong, or partially correct.</p>

<p>** So why not demistify the process? **</p>

<h1>Enter the C preprocessor.</h1>

<p>You may have heard of the C Preprocessor. It’s the first stage of a c or c++ file compilation,
and it’s actually responsible for things such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>inclusion of header files</strong> (it does so by replacing
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#include &lt;header.h&gt;</code> with the content of this file, and the file it includes recursively),</li>
  <li><strong>macro expansion</strong>, such as the famous comparison of two numbers (a greater than b). In essence, if you define
 the following macro <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#define gt(a, b) ((a &gt; b) ? 1 : 0)</code>, then in a statement such as this:</li>
</ul>

<div lang="c" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> if (gt (5, 3)) printf ("The first parameter is greater than the second.\n");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gt (5, 3)</code> gets expanded to the macro definition, so after the preprocessor has run you end up with something like this:</p>

<div lang="c" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> if (((5 &gt; 3) ? 1 : 0)) printf ("The first parameter is greater than the second.\n");
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>conditional compilation</strong> (things such as:</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="cp">#ifdef WIN32 
</span>    <span class="n">printf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"We are on windows</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span> 
<span class="cp">#endif</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>amongst others. You can see it for yourself. Write the hello world program, and pass it to cpp: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cpp hello_world.c</code></p>

<p>So now that we know what it does it’s time to demistify a common myth regarding it: <em>Some people believe
that the header files include the function to be called.</em>. <strong>That’s wrong.</strong> What it does include is 
<strong>function prototypes</strong> (and some type definitions, etc) <strong>only</strong>. It doesn’t include the body of the function
to be called.</p>

<p>Some people find that fact quite surprising, though, it isn’t, if you get to understand what the compiler
does with it.</p>

<h1>Say hello to the compiler.</h1>

<p>Here we are gonna unmask another pile of misconceptions. First of all, some people think that when they call 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc</code> on the command line they are actually calling the compiler. <strong>They are not.</strong> <em>In fact they are calling
the software commonly called <strong>the compilation driver</strong>, whose job is to run all the software needed to fully
turn source to binary, including preprocessors, the actual compiler, an assembler and finally the linker</em></p>

<p>Having said that, the actual compiler that’s getting called when you call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc</code> is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cc1</code>. You may have seen it some times when the driver reports errors. Wanna take a look at it, to make sure I’m not lying to you? 
(Hint: I’m not!) Fair enough. Why don’t you type this in the command line: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc -print-prog-name=cc1</code>. It should tell you where the actual compiler is located in your system.</p>

<p>So now that we have this (misconception) out of our minds, we can continue with our analysis. Last time we talked
about it, we said that the header files include <strong>prototypes</strong> and not the whole function.</p>

<p>You may know that in C, you usually declare a function, before you use it. The primary reason for doing this
is to provide the compiler with the ability to perform <strong>type checking</strong>, that is to check that the arguments
passed are correct, both in number, and in type, and to verify that the returned value (assuming there is one)
is being used correctly. Below is a program that demonstrates the function prototype:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">add_nums</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">first</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">second</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kt">int</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">printf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"5 + 5 results in %d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">add_nums</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">));</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kt">int</span>
<span class="nf">add_nums</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">first</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">second</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">first</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">second</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this particular example, the prototype gives the compiler a wide variety of information. It tells it
that function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_nums</code> takes two int arguments and returns an integer to the calling function. Now the
compiler can verify that I am passing correct arguments to it when I call it inside printf. If I don’t include
the function prototype, and do something slightly evil such as calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_nums</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code> arguments then 
this might happen:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>5 + 4 results in 2054324224
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that you know that the compiler (the real one) only needs the prototype and not the actual function code,
you may be wondering how the compiler actually compiles it if it doesn’t know it’s code.</p>

<p>Now is the time to bring down another missconception. The word <em>compiler</em> is just a fancy name for software
otherwise known as <em>translators</em>. A <em>translator’s</em> job is to get input and turn it from one language (source language) to a second language (target language), whatever that may be. Most of the times, when you compile software,
you compile it to run in your computer, which runs on a processor from the x86 architecture family of processors.
A processor is typically associated with an assembly language for that architecture (which is just human friendly
mnemonics for common processor tasks), so your <em>x86 computer runs x86 assembly</em> (ok that’s not 100% true, but for
simplicity’s sake at the moment, it should serve. We will see why it’s not true later.) So the compiler 
(in a typical translation) translates (compiles) your C source code to x86 assembly. 
You can see this by compiling your hello world example and passing the compiler the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-S</code> (which asks it to stop,
after x86 assembly is produced) parameter, likewise <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc -S hello.c</code>.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>At this part, we saw how the compiler and the preprocessor work with our code, in an attempt to demistify the 
so called library calls. In the next part, we are going to study the assembler and the linker, and for the final
part the loader and the kernel.</p>

          <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This week was spent investigating the runtime and debugging executables with gdb.
It was interesting in the sense that it provided me with some interesting
pieces of information. Without any further ado, let’s present our findings:</p>

<h2>My findings</h2>

<p>Before starting out playing with libpthread, and glibc, I wanted to make sure
that the goruntime behaved the way I believed it behaved, and make some further
assurances about the goruntime. These assurances had to do with the total number
of goroutines and the total number of machine threads at various checkpoints
in the language runtime.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first thread in the program is initialised during <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code>.</li>
  <li>The number of m’s (kernel threads) is dependent on the number of goroutines.
The runtime basically attempts to create an equal amount of m’s to run the goroutines.
We can observe everytime a new goroutine is created, there is a number of calls
to initiate a new kernel thread.</li>
  <li>There are at least two kernel threads. One that supports the runtime (mainly the 
garbage collector) and one that executes the code of the go program.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is only one small piece of code in the goruntime that creates some sort of
confusion for me, and that is the code for a new m initialisation. Let me first
present the code that confuses me:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="n">M</span><span class="o">*</span>
<span class="nf">runtime_newm</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">...</span>
	<span class="n">mp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">runtime_mal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">sizeof</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">mp</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="p">...</span>
	<span class="n">mcommoninit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mp</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="n">mp</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">g0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">runtime_malg</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">nil</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="p">...</span>
	<span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pthread_attr_init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">attr</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">runtime_throw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"pthread_attr_init"</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pthread_attr_setdetachstate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">attr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">runtime_throw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"pthread_attr_setdetachstate"</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I purposely compacted the function for brevity, as it only serves as a demonstration for a point.
Now, my confusion lies in the line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mp-&gt;g0 = runtime_malg(-1, nil, nil)</code>. It is a piece of code
that allocates memory for a new goroutine. Now I am ok with that, <strong>but</strong> what I do not understand
is that new kernel threads (m’s) are supposed to be pick and run a goroutine from the global 
goroutine pool - that is run an existing one, and not create a new one. Now, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_malg</code>
is given parameters that don’t initialise a new goroutine properly, but still, new memory
is allocated for a new goroutine, and is returned to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mp-&gt;g0</code> from runtime_malg.</p>

<p>Assuming I have not misunderstood something, and I am not mistaken (which is kind of likely), 
this is behavior that could lead to a number of questions and/or problems. For instance,
what happens to the goroutine created by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_malg</code>? Is it killed after the m is assigned
a new goroutine to execute? Is it parked on the goroutine global list? Is it just ignored?
Does it affect the runtime scheduler’s goroutine count? This is the last thing I feel I wanna
clear out regarding gccgo’s runtime.</p>

<h2>gdb</h2>

<p>For this week, I also run the executables created by gccgo through gdb. It was a fertile attempt
that, most of the time, confirmed my findings in the goruntime. It also provided us with some
other nice pieces of information regarding the crashing of goroutines, but also left me with a 
question.</p>

<p>The code in question that I run through gdb is this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="n">package</span> <span class="n">main</span>

    <span class="n">say</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"hello"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Your very typical hello world like goroutine program. Now, setting a break point in main 
(not the program’s main, that’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.main</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> as far as the runtime is concerned is
 the runtime entry point, in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go-main.c</code>) and running it through gdb yields the following
results:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">Breakpoint 1, main <span class="o">()</span> at ../../../gcc_source/libgo/runtime/go-main.c:52

2: __pthread_total <span class="o">=</span> 1
1: runtime_sched.mcount <span class="o">=</span> 1</code></pre></figure>

<p>Up until now, nothing unexpected. The kernel thread is registered with the runtime scheduler
during its initialisation process in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code> and that’ why the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_sched.mcount</code>
is reported to be zero many times before schedinit is run.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">68 __go_go <span class="o">(</span>mainstart, NULL<span class="o">)</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="o">(</span>gdb<span class="o">)</span> display runtime_sched.gcount
3: runtime_sched.gcount <span class="o">=</span> 0</code></pre></figure>

<p>That too is ok, because a new goroutine is registered with the scheduler during the call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__go_go</code>. Now I am gonna fast forward a bit, to a more interesting point.</p>

but gdb reports that 3 are active. Anyway, let'</span>s <span class="k">continue</span>:

<p>Oh my goodness. From a first glance, this seems to be a very serious inconsistency between libpthread and the goruntime.
At this point, the go scheduler reports 3 threads (3 registered threads, that means 
that flow of execution has passed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mcommoninit</code>, the kernel thread initialisation function
which also registers the kernel thread with the runtime_scheduler) whereas libpthread reports 2 threads.</p>

<p><strong>But WAIT! Where are you going? Things are about to get even more interesting!</strong></p>

<p>GDB reports 4 threads. Yes, 4 threads ladies and gentlemen. Now take a look closely.
3 threads are in the same frame, with the one with id 4 being the one currently executed.
And there is also a pattern. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x01da48ec</code> is the value of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eip</code> register for all 3 of them.</p>

<p>That’s one thing that is for certain. Now I already have an idea. Why not change
the current thread to the one with id 7? I’m sold to the idea, let’s do this:</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Apparently, there is still much debugging left to checkout what is really happening.
But we have got some leads in the right direction, that hopefully will lead us to 
finally finding out where the problem lies, and correct it.</p>

<p>Most importantly, in my immediate plans, before iI start playing around with libpthread
is to attempt the same debugging run on the same code, under linux (x86). Seeing as
go is clean on linux, it would provide some clues as to what the expected results 
should be, and where the execution differentiates substantially, a clue
that might be vital to finding the problem.</p>

          <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This week was spent attempting to debug the gccgo runtime via print statements. There were many things
that I gained from this endeavour. The most significant of which, is the fact that I have got a great
deal of information regarding the bootstrapping of a go process. Let’s proceed into presenting this 
week’s findings, shall we?</p>

<h1>Findings</h1>

<h2>The process bootstrapping sequence</h2>

<p>The code that begins a new go-process is conveniently located in a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go-main.c</code>, the most significant
part of which is the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="kt">int</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_check</span> <span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_args</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">byte</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_osinit</span> <span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_schedinit</span> <span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">__go_go</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mainstart</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_mstart</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">runtime_m</span> <span class="p">());</span>
  <span class="n">abort</span> <span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span>
<span class="nf">mainstart</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">arg</span> <span class="n">__attribute__</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">unused</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_main</span> <span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The process is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_check</code> runs and registers the os_Args and syscall_Envs as runtime_roots with the garbage collector. I am still investigating what this function exactly is doing, but it seems like some early initialisation of the garbage collector</li>
  <li>Secondly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_args</code> is run. It’s job is to call a specific argument handler for the arguments passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>.</li>
  <li>Thirdly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_osinit</code> is run, whose job is to call the lowlevel _CPU_COUNT function, to get the number of CPUs (in a specific data structure that represents a set of CPUs)</li>
  <li>After that, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code> is run, whose job is to create the very first goroutine (g) and system thread (m), and continues with parsing the command line arguments, and the environment variables. After that it sets the maximum number of cpus that are to be used (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GOMAXPROCS</code>), runs the first goroutine, and does some last pieces of the scheduler’s initialisation.</li>
  <li>Following <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__go_go</code> is run, a function whose purpose is to create a new queue, tell it to execute the function that is passed to it as the first parameter, and then queue the goroutine in the
global ready-to-run goroutine pool.</li>
  <li>Last but not least, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_mstart</code> runs, which seems to be starting te execution of the kernel thread created during <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The very last piece of code that is run (and most probably the most important) is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_main</code>. Remember that this is passed as a parameter to a goroutine created during the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__go_go</code> call, and its job is to mark the goroutine that called it as <em>the main os thread</em>, to initialise the sceduler, and create a goroutine whose job is to release unused memory (from the heap) back to the OS.
It then starts executing the process user defined instructions (the code the programmer run) via a call to a
macro that directs it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__go_init_main</code> in the assembly generated by the compiler.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Runtime_main</code> is also the function that terminates the execution of a go process, with a call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_exit</code>
which seems to be a macro to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> function.</p>

<h2>Other findings</h2>

<p>During our debugging sessions we found out that the total count of kernel threads that are running in a simple program is at least two.
The first one is the bootstrap M, (the one initialised during the program’s initialisation, inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code>) and at least another one, (I am still invistigating the validity of the following claim) 
created to be used by the garbage collector.</p>

<p>A simple go program such as one doing arithmetic or printing a helloworld like message evidently has no issue
running.
The issues arrise when we use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go statement</code>. With all our debugging messages activated, this is how a simple
go program flows:</p>

<h1>Work for the next week</h1>

<p>I will of course continue to print debug until I have knowledge of the exact flow of execution in the go
runtime. Right now I have very good knowledge of the flow, but there are some things that I need to sort out.
For instance it is not exactly clear to me why we call certain functions, or what they are supposed to be doing at certain parts. After I sort this out,  I also plan to start debugging the libpthread to see what’s libpthreads status
during a hello world like program, and during a goroutine powered program, to get to see if we get
to find something interesting in libpthread (like how many threads does libpthread report against how
many the goruntime reports)</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>This week was revolving around the print debugging in the gccgo runtime in search
for clues regarding the creation of new threads under the goruntime, so as to see
if there is something wrong with the runtime itself, or the way the runtime 
interacts with the libpthread.</p>

<h2>(partial presentation of) findings</h2>

<p>During print debugging the gccgo runtime, I didn’t notice anything abnormal or 
unusual so far. For example, the code that does trigger the assertion failure
seems to work at least once, since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pthread_create()</code> returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> at least once.</p>

<p>This is expected behavior, since we already have stated that there is at least
one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> (kernel thread) created at the initialisation of the program’s runtime.</p>

<p>If however, we try to use a <em>go statement</em> in our program, to make usage of a 
goroutine, the runtime still fails at the usual assertion fail, however the 
output of the program is this:</p>

<div lang="shell" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@debian:~/Software/Experiments/go# ./a.out
[DEBUG] pthread_create returned 0
a.out: ./pthread/pt-create.c:167: __pthread_create_internal: Assertion `({ mach_port_t ktid = __mach_thread_self (); int ok = thread-&gt;kernel_thread == ktid;
__mach_port_deallocate ((__mach_task_self + 0), ktid); ok; })' failed.
Aborted
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above output can give us some pieces of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pthread_create()</code> is called at least once.</li>
  <li>it executes successfuly and without errors - libpthread code suggests that 0 is returned upon successful execution and creation of a thread</li>
  <li>However the assertion is still triggered, which we know it’s getting triggered during thread creation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second bullet point is also being supported by the fact that even if you exe
cute something as simple as hello world in go, a new M is created, so you get
something along the lines of this as an output:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">root@debian:~/Software/Experiments/go# ./a.out
<span class="o">[</span>DEBUG] pthread_create returned 0
Hello World!
root@debian:~/Software/Experiments/go#</code></pre></figure>

<p>There is however something that the above piece of code doesn’t tell us, 
but it would be useful to know: <em>How many times did we create a new thread?</em>
So we modify our gcc’s source code to see how many times the runtimes 
attempts to create a new kernel thread (M). This is what we get out of it:</p>

<div lang="shell" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@debian:~/Software/Experiments/go# ./a.out
[DEBUG] Preparing to create a new thread.
[DEBUG] pthread_create returned 0
a.out: ./pthread/pt-create.c:167: __pthread_create_internal: Assertion `({ mach_port_t ktid = __mach_thread_self (); int ok = thread-&gt;kernel_thread == ktid;
__mach_port_deallocate ((__mach_task_self + 0), ktid); ok; })' failed.
[DEBUG] Preparing to create a new thread.
aborted.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The code at this point in the runtime is this:</p>

<p>We can deduce two things about our situation right now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is <strong>at least one</strong> thread successfully created, and there is an attempt
to create another one.</li>
  <li>The second time, there is a failure before pthread_create is called.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Continuation of work.</h2>

<p>I have been following this course of path the last week. I presented
some of my findings, and hope to soon be able to write an exhaustive
report on what exactly it is that causes the bug.</p>

          <p>This week was spent studying the go language’s runtime and studying the behaviour of various go programs when executed under the Hurd. I learnt a variety of new things, and got some 
new clues about the problem.</p>

<h2>The new libgo clues</h2>

<p>I already know that <em>M’s are the “real” kernel schedulable threads</em> and <em>G’s are the go runtime managed ones (goroutines)</em>. Last time I had gone through the go runtime’s code I had noticed that neither of them get created, so there must be an issue with thread creation. <strong>But since there is at least one of each created during the program’s initialization, how come
most programs are able to run, and issues present themselves when we manually attempt to run a goroutine?</strong></p>

<p>I will admit that the situation looks strange. So I decided to look more into it. Before we go any further, I have to embed the issues I had when I run goroutine powered programs under the Hurd.</p>

<div lang="shell" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@debian:~/Software/Experiments/go# ./a.out
a.out: ./pthread/pt-create.c:167: __pthread_create_internal: Assertion `({ mach_port_t ktid = __mach_thread_self (); int ok = thread-&gt;kernel_thread == ktid;
__mach_port_deallocate ((__mach_task_self + 0), ktid); ok; })' failed.
Aborted
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__pthread_create_internal</code> is a libpthread function that gets called when a new posix thread is instanciated. So we know that when we call a goroutine, apart from the goroutine,
there is at least one kernel thread created, otherwise, if a new goroutine was created, and not a new kernel thread (M) why wasn’t it matched with an existing kernel thread
(remember there is at least one).</p>

<p>That made me look into the go runtime some more. I found a lot of things, that I can not enumerate here, but amongst the most interesting ones, was the following piece of code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="c1">// Create a new m.  It will start off with a call to runtime_mstart.</span>

<p>This is the code that creates a new kernel thread. Notice the line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ret = pthread_create(&amp;tid, &amp;attr, runtime_mstart, mp);</code>. It’s obvious that it creates a new kernel thread,
so that explains why we get the specific error. But what is not explained is that since we do have at least one in program startup, why is this specific error only triggered when
we manually create a go routine?</p>

<h2>Go programs under the Hurd</h2>

<p>Apart from studying Go’s runtime source code, I also run some experiments under the Hurd. I got some very weird results that I am investigating, but I would like to share nonetheless.
Consider the following piece of code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="k">package</span> <span class="n">main</span>

<span class="k">import</span> <span class="s">"fmt"</span>

<span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">say</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="m">5</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">fmt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">func</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">say</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"world"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">say</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"hello"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A very basic example that can demonstrate goroutines. Now, if we change <strong>one</strong> of the say functions inside main to a goroutine, this happens:</p>

<div lang="shell" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@debian:~/Software/Experiments/go# ./a.out
a.out: ./pthread/pt-create.c:167: __pthread_create_internal: Assertion `({ mach_port_t ktid = __mach_thread_self (); int ok = thread-&gt;kernel_thread == ktid;
__mach_port_deallocate ((__mach_task_self + 0), ktid); ok; })' failed.
Aborted
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> if we change <strong>BOTH</strong> of these functions to goroutines (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go say("world")</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go say("hello")</code>), this happens:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">root@debian:~/Software/Experiments/go# ./a.out
root@debian:~/Software/Experiments/go# </code></pre></figure>

<p>Wait a minute. It can’t be! Did it execute correctly? Where is the output?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">root@debian:~/Software/Experiments/go# <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$?</span>
0
root@debian:~/Software/Experiments/go#</code></pre></figure>

<p>It reports that it has executed correctly. But there is no output.</p>

<h2>What I am doing next</h2>

<p>I will continue reading through the go runtime for some clues. On the more active size, I am writing a custom test case for goroutine testing under the Hurd, while also doing some analysis
on the programs that run there (currently studying the assembly generated for these programs) to see how they differ and why we get this particular behavior.</p>
