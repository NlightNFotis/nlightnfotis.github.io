          <p>In the previous part of this little series, we talked about the compiler, and what it does 
with the header files, in our attempt to demistify their usage. In this part, I want to show you
what’s the compiler’s output, and how we create our file.</p>

<h1>The compiler’s composition</h1>

<p>Generally speaking, a <em>compiler</em> belongs to a family of software called <strong>translators</strong>. 
A translator’s job is to read some source code in a source language, and generate (translate it to) 
some source code in a target language.</p>

<p>Now, you might think that most compilers you know don’t do that. You input a (source code) file, 
and you get a binary file, ready to run when you want it to. Yes that’s what it does, but it’s not
the compiler that does all this. If you remember from the last installment of this series,
when you call the compiler like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc some_file.c</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang some_file.c</code>, in essence you are
calling the compilation driver, with the file as a parameter. The compilation driver then calls
1) the preprocessor, 2) the (actual) compiler, 3) the assembler and last but not least the linker.
At least when it comes to gcc, these pieces of software are called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cpp</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cc1</code>, 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gas</code> (executable name is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as</code>)  and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collect2</code> (executable name is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ld</code>) respectively.</p>

<p>From that little software collection up top, that we call the compiler, we can easily take notice
of at least 3 (yeah, that’s right) translators, that act as we mentioned earlier, 
that is take some input in a source language, and produce some output to a target language.</p>

<p>The first is the preprocessor. The preprocessor accepts source code in C as a source language,
and produces source code again in C (as a target language), but with the output having various
elements of the source code resolved, such as header file inclusion, macro expansion, etc.</p>

<p>The second is the compiler. The compiler accepts (in our case) C source code, as a source language,
and translates it to some architecture’s assembly language. In my case, when I talk about the 
compiler, I’m gonna assume that it produces x86 assembly.</p>

<p>The last one, is the assembler, which accepts as input some machine’s architecture assembly
language, and produces what’s called binary, or object representation of it, that is it translates
the assembly mnemonics directly to the bytes they correspond to, in the target architecture.</p>

<p>At this point, one could also argue that the linker is also a translator, accepting binary, and 
translating it to an executable file, that is, resolving references, and fitting the binary code
on the segments of the file that is to be produced. For example, on a typical GNU/Linux system,
this phase produces the executable ELF file.</p>

<h1>The (actual) compiler’s output: x86 assembly.</h1>

<p>Before we go any further, I would like to show you what the compiler really creates:</p>

<p>For the typical hello world program we demonstrated in our first installment, the compiler
will output the following assembly code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-gas" data-lang="gas">	.file	"hello.c"
	.section	.rodata
.LC0:
	.string	"Hello world!"
	.text
	.globl	main
	.type	main, @function
main:
	pushq	%rbp
	movq	%rsp, %rbp
	subq	$16, %rsp
	movl	%edi, -4(%rbp)
	movq	%rsi, -16(%rbp)
	movl	$.LC0, %edi
	call	puts
	movl	$0, %eax
	leave
	ret
	.size	main, .-main
	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) 4.8.2 20131212 (Red Hat 4.8.2-7)"
	.section	.note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits</code></pre></figure>

<p>To produce the above file, we had to use the following gcc invocation command:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc -S -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -o hello.S hello.c</code>. 
We used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables</code> to remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.cfi</code> directives, which tell <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gas</code> 
(the gnu assembler) to emit Dwarf Call Frame Information tags, which are used to reconstruct
a stack backtrace when a frame pointer is missing.</p>

<p>For more usefull compilation flags, to control the intermediary compilation flow, try these:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-E</code>: stop after preprocessing, and produce a *.i file</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-S</code>: we used this, stop after the compiler, and produce a *.s file</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-c</code>: stop after the assembler, and produce a *.o file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default behaviour is to use none, and stop after the linker has run. If you want to run a 
full compilation and keep all the intermediate files, use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-save-temps</code> flag.</p>

<h1>From source to binary: the assembler.</h1>

<p>The next part of the compilation process, is the assembler. We have already discussed what
the assembler does, so here we are going to see it in practice. If you have followed so far,
you should have two files, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello.c</code>, which is the hello world’s C source code file,
and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello.S</code> which is what we created earlier, the compiler’s (x86) assembly output.</p>

<p>The assembler operates on that last file as you can imagine, and to see it running, and emit
binary, we need to invoke it like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as -o hello.bin hello.S</code>, and produces this:</p>

<h1>Last but not least: the linker</h1>

<p>We saw what the assembler emits, which is to say, binary code. However, that binary code
still needs further processing. To explain that, we need to go back a little.</p>

<p>In our first installment of the series, we said that when you call a function like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printf()</code>,
the compiler only needs its prototype to do type checking and ensure that you use it legally.
For that you include the header file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdio.h</code>. But since that contains the function prototype only,
where is the source code for that function? Surely, it must be somewhere, since it executes 
successfully to begin with, but we haven’t met the source code for printf so far, so where is it?</p>

<p>The function’s source code is located in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.so</code> (shared object) of the standard C library,
which in my system (Fedora 19, x64) is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libc-2.17.so</code>. I don’t want to expand on that further,
as I plan to do so on the next series installment, however, what we have said so far is enough
for you to understand the linker’s usage:</p>

<p>The linker resolves the undefined (thus far) reference to printf, by finding the reference to
the printf symbol and (in layman’s talk) 
making a pointer to point to it so that execution can jump to printf’s code
when we have to do that during our program’s execution.</p>

<p>To invoke the linker on our file, <a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.20/ld/Options.html#Options">at least according to it’s documentation</a>, 
we should do the following: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ld -o hello.out /lib/crt0.o hello.bin -lc</code>. Then we should
be able to run the file like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./hello.out</code>.</p>

<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p>That’s this end of this part 2 of my series that explains how your code turns into binary, and how
your computer (at least when it comes to the software side) runs it. In part 3, I am going to discuss
in greater length, the C library, and the kernel.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>The past two to three days, I have been busy with creating my very own Linux distribution
using the well known <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org">Linux from Scratch</a>. This post is 
an accounting of my experience with the process, what I liked, what I did learn from that,
what was surprising to me and more.</p>

<h1>Linux from Scratch: An introduction</h1>

<p>If you are here, then you most likely already know what <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.com/">linux from scratch</a>
is, but for the sake of completeness (or in the case that you don’t know what it is, but are
so keen on learning)  I will provide an introduction about it here.</p>

<p>Linux from scratch is a book (from now on, <em>lfs</em>), providing a series of steps that guide you to the creation of
a fully function GNU/Linux distribution. Although the original book creates a “barebones”
distribution, with only fundamental tools in it, the distribution created provides a fine
enviroment for further experimentation or customization.</p>

<p>Apart from the basic book, the lfs project also has 3-4 books to read if you want to extend
the basic system (such as blfs, Beyond Linux from Scratch) or if you want to automate the process,
create a distribution that is more secure, or how to cross-compile an lfs system for different machines.</p>

<h1>My experience with building LFS</h1>

<h2>A small introduction about my background</h2>

<p>I have been a UNIX (-like) systems (full-time) user for about 2.5 years now. During that time
I had seen myself from being what you would call a Linux newbie, not knowing how to use
a system without a GUI installed (have I mentioned that Ubuntu was my favourite distribution) to being an arguably experienced UNIX programmer, trying to learn more about the
various aspects of UNIX systems, and delving deeper and deeper into them every day
(while also feeling pain if using something other than a UNIX like system).</p>

<p>During that time, I have learned about the Unix way of working with the system, using the shell and the system’s toolchain to write software and other wise manipulate the system. I
ditched my old knowledge about IDEs and GUIs, and set out to master the command line and the associated tools (Anecdote: I remember, when I first came from to Unix from Windows, to searching the net for a C/C++ IDE to do development.) I remember reading about
how people worked another way in Unix land, using an editor, and the shell to work, and I 
decided to force myself to learn to work that way. I still remember trying to use vim and gcc, 
and ending up liking this way better because it seemed a more natural way to interact with
the software development process, than using a ide and pressing the equivalent of a “play”
button, so that magic ensues for the next few seconds until I have a result.</p>

<p>Time has passed since then, and going through hours and hours of reading and working with
the system, I did learn quite a lot about it. My Google Summer of Code experience in 2013
expanded my system knowledge even further (that’s what you get when you have to work
with the system kernel, the C library and a compiler).</p>

<p>But in all that time, of using Unix like systems, I never had the chance to create one myself.
And although my background did allow me to know quite a few things of the inner workings
of a system like that, I never actually saw all these software systems combining in front
of my very eyes to create that beauty we know as a GNU/Linux distribution. And that left
me a bad taste, because I knew what was happening, but I wanted to see it happen right 
in front of my eyes.</p>

<p>Knowing about the existence of lfs, and not actually going through it also made matters worse
for me, as I knew that I could actually “patch” that knowledge gap of mine, but I never really
tried to do that. I felt that I was missing on a lot, and that lfs would be instrumental to my
understanding of a Linux system. Having gone through that some years ago, and getting
stuck at the very beginning had also created an innate fear in me, that it was something
that would be above my own powers.</p>

<p>Until two days ago, when I said to myself: “You know what? I have seen and done a lot 
of things in a UNIX system. I am now much more experienced than I was when I last did it.
And I know I want to at least try it, even if it will only give me nothing but infinite confusion 
Because if I do manage to get it, I will learn so many more things, or at least get assured
that my preexisting knowledge was correct” And that thought was the greatest motive I had
to do that in a fairly long time.</p>

<p>So, I sat at my desk, grabbed a cup of coffee and off I went!</p>

<h2>The process</h2>

<h3>Preparation and the temporary toolchain</h3>

<p>The book is itself several chapters long, each of which perform another “big step” in the
creation of the distribution.</p>

<p>The first few chapters are preparatory chapters, where you ensure the integrity of the 
building environment, and download any building dependencies you may be lacking,
create a new partition that will host the lfs system, and create the user account that
will do the building of the temporary toolchain.</p>

<p>The temporary toolchain building is a more exciting process. In essence
you compile and collect several pieces of software that will later be used
to compile the distribution’s toolchain and other software.</p>

<p>You start of with building binutils, and that is to get a working assembler and linker. 
After having a working assembler and linker, you proceed with compiling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc</code>.
Next on is unpacking the linux headers, so that you can compile (and link against them)
the glibc.</p>

<p>Having the basic parts of the toolchain compiled, you then proceed with installing other
software that is needed in the temporary toolchain, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gawk</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">patch</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perl</code>
etc.</p>

<h3>Building the main system</h3>

<p>After getting done with the temporary toolchain, you then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chroot</code> into the lfs partition.
You start of with creating the needed directories (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/boot</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home</code> etc)
and then continue with building the distribution software, utilising the temporary toolchain.
For instance, you construct a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc</code>, you compile <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bzip</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shadow</code>
utility that manages the handling of passwords etc, all while making sure that things don’t
break, and running countless tests (that sometimes take longer than what the package
took to compile) to ensure that what you build is functional and reliable.</p>

<h3>Final configuration</h3>

<p>Next one on the list, is the various configuration files that reside in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc</code>, and the setup
of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sysvinit</code>, the distribution’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init</code> system.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, you are compiling the linux kernel and setting up grub so that the
system is bootable.</p>

<p>At this point, if all has gone well, and you reset, you should boot into your new lfs system.</p>

<h1>What did I gain from that?</h1>

<p>Building lfs was a very time consuming process for me. It must have taken about 7-8
hours at the very least. Not so much because of the compilation and testing (I was compiling
with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAKEFLAGS='-j 4'</code> on a Core i5), but because I didn’t complete some steps
correctly, and later needed to go back and redo them, along with everything that followed and the time it took to research some issues, programs or various other things
before I did issue a command at the shell.</p>

<p>Now if I were to answer the question “What did I gain from that”, my answer would be
along the lines of “Infinite confusion, and some great insight at some points”.</p>

<p>To elaborate on that,</p>

<ul>
  <li>lfs mostly served as a reassurance that indeed, what I did know
about the system was mostly correct.</li>
  <li>I did have the chance to see the distribution
get built right before my eyes, which was something I longed for a great amount of time.</li>
  <li>It did make me somewhat more familiar with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code>
cycle</li>
  <li>It made me realise that the directories in the system are the simple result of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> command, and that configuration files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/folder</code> are handwritten plain files. (<em>yeah, I feel stupid about that one - I don’t know what I was expecting.</em> This was probably the result of the “magic involved” that the distro making process entailed for me)</li>
  <li>I got to see the specific software that is needed to create a distribution, and demonstrate to me how I can build it, customize that build, or even change that software to my liking</li>
  <li>And last but not least, something that nearly every lfs user says after a successful try:
I knew that package managers did a great many things in order to maintain the system, and that much
of the work I would normally have to do was done nearly automatically 
but boy, was I underestimating them. After lfs, I developed a new appreciation for a
good package manager.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p><em>Lfs was, for the most part, a great experience.</em> <strong>As a knowledge expander, it works great.</strong>
<strong>As a system that you keep and continue to maintain? I don’t know.</strong> I know that people have
done that in the past, but I decided against maintaining my build, as I figured it would be
very time consuming, and that if I ever wanted to gain the experience of maintaining a distro,
I would probably fork something like <a href="http://www.crux.nu">Crux</a>.</p>

<p>In the end if you ask me if I can recommend that to you, I will say that I’m not so sure.
<strong>It will provide you with some insight into the internals of a GNU/Linux distribution, but it 
won’t make you a better programmer as some people claim</strong> (most of the process revolves
around the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code> cycle, and some conf files handwriting).</p>

<p><strong>In the end, it is yourself who you should ask. Do you want that knowledge? Is it worth the hassle for you?
Do you want the bragging rights? Are you crazy enough to want to maintain it?</strong> 
<em>These are all questions that you get as many answers to them as the people you ask.</em></p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Before we get any further, it might be good if we provided some context.</p>

<h1>Hello world. Again.</h1>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span>
<span class="kt">int</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">printf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello world!</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Every user space (read: application) programmer, has written a hello world program. 
Only god knows how many times this program has been written. Yet, 
most programmers’ knowledge of the program is limited to something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>It sends the string passed as a parameter to the system to print.</li>
    <li>It takes the printf function from stdio.h and prints the string</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>and various other things, which are anywhere between plain wrong, or partially correct.</p>

<p>** So why not demistify the process? **</p>

<h1>Enter the C preprocessor.</h1>

<p>You may have heard of the C Preprocessor. It’s the first stage of a c or c++ file compilation,
and it’s actually responsible for things such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>inclusion of header files</strong> (it does so by replacing
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#include &lt;header.h&gt;</code> with the content of this file, and the file it includes recursively),</li>
  <li><strong>macro expansion</strong>, such as the famous comparison of two numbers (a greater than b). In essence, if you define
 the following macro <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#define gt(a, b) ((a &gt; b) ? 1 : 0)</code>, then in a statement such as this:</li>
</ul>

<div lang="c" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> if (gt (5, 3)) printf ("The first parameter is greater than the second.\n");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gt (5, 3)</code> gets expanded to the macro definition, so after the preprocessor has run you end up with something like this:</p>

<div lang="c" class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> if (((5 &gt; 3) ? 1 : 0)) printf ("The first parameter is greater than the second.\n");
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>conditional compilation</strong> (things such as:</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="cp">#ifdef WIN32 
</span>    <span class="n">printf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"We are on windows</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span> 
<span class="cp">#endif</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>amongst others. You can see it for yourself. Write the hello world program, and pass it to cpp: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cpp hello_world.c</code></p>

<p>So now that we know what it does it’s time to demistify a common myth regarding it: <em>Some people believe
that the header files include the function to be called.</em>. <strong>That’s wrong.</strong> What it does include is 
<strong>function prototypes</strong> (and some type definitions, etc) <strong>only</strong>. It doesn’t include the body of the function
to be called.</p>

<p>Some people find that fact quite surprising, though, it isn’t, if you get to understand what the compiler
does with it.</p>

<h1>Say hello to the compiler.</h1>

<p>Here we are gonna unmask another pile of misconceptions. First of all, some people think that when they call 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc</code> on the command line they are actually calling the compiler. <strong>They are not.</strong> <em>In fact they are calling
the software commonly called <strong>the compilation driver</strong>, whose job is to run all the software needed to fully
turn source to binary, including preprocessors, the actual compiler, an assembler and finally the linker</em></p>

<p>Having said that, the actual compiler that’s getting called when you call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc</code> is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cc1</code>. You may have seen it some times when the driver reports errors. Wanna take a look at it, to make sure I’m not lying to you? 
(Hint: I’m not!) Fair enough. Why don’t you type this in the command line: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc -print-prog-name=cc1</code>. It should tell you where the actual compiler is located in your system.</p>

<p>So now that we have this (misconception) out of our minds, we can continue with our analysis. Last time we talked
about it, we said that the header files include <strong>prototypes</strong> and not the whole function.</p>

<p>You may know that in C, you usually declare a function, before you use it. The primary reason for doing this
is to provide the compiler with the ability to perform <strong>type checking</strong>, that is to check that the arguments
passed are correct, both in number, and in type, and to verify that the returned value (assuming there is one)
is being used correctly. Below is a program that demonstrates the function prototype:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp">
</span>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this particular example, the prototype gives the compiler a wide variety of information. It tells it
that function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_nums</code> takes two int arguments and returns an integer to the calling function. Now the
compiler can verify that I am passing correct arguments to it when I call it inside printf. If I don’t include
the function prototype, and do something slightly evil such as calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add_nums</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float</code> arguments then 
this might happen:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>5 + 4 results in 2054324224
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that you know that the compiler (the real one) only needs the prototype and not the actual function code,
you may be wondering how the compiler actually compiles it if it doesn’t know it’s code.</p>

<p>Now is the time to bring down another missconception. The word <em>compiler</em> is just a fancy name for software
otherwise known as <em>translators</em>. A <em>translator’s</em> job is to get input and turn it from one language (source language) to a second language (target language), whatever that may be. Most of the times, when you compile software,
you compile it to run in your computer, which runs on a processor from the x86 architecture family of processors.
A processor is typically associated with an assembly language for that architecture (which is just human friendly
mnemonics for common processor tasks), so your <em>x86 computer runs x86 assembly</em> (ok that’s not 100% true, but for
simplicity’s sake at the moment, it should serve. We will see why it’s not true later.) So the compiler 
(in a typical translation) translates (compiles) your C source code to x86 assembly. 
You can see this by compiling your hello world example and passing the compiler the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-S</code> (which asks it to stop,
after x86 assembly is produced) parameter, likewise <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc -S hello.c</code>.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>At this part, we saw how the compiler and the preprocessor work with our code, in an attempt to demistify the 
so called library calls. In the next part, we are going to study the assembler and the linker, and for the final
part the loader and the kernel.</p>

          <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This week was spent investigating the runtime and debugging executables with gdb.
It was interesting in the sense that it provided me with some interesting
pieces of information. Without any further ado, let’s present our findings:</p>

<h2>My findings</h2>

<p>Before starting out playing with libpthread, and glibc, I wanted to make sure
that the goruntime behaved the way I believed it behaved, and make some further
assurances about the goruntime. These assurances had to do with the total number
of goroutines and the total number of machine threads at various checkpoints
in the language runtime.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first thread in the program is initialised during <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code>.</li>
  <li>The number of m’s (kernel threads) is dependent on the number of goroutines.
The runtime basically attempts to create an equal amount of m’s to run the goroutines.
We can observe everytime a new goroutine is created, there is a number of calls
to initiate a new kernel thread.</li>
  <li>There are at least two kernel threads. One that supports the runtime (mainly the 
garbage collector) and one that executes the code of the go program.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is only one small piece of code in the goruntime that creates some sort of
confusion for me, and that is the code for a new m initialisation. Let me first
present the code that confuses me:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="n">M</span><span class="o">*</span>
<span class="nf">runtime_newm</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">...</span>
	<span class="n">mp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">runtime_mal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">sizeof</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">mp</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="p">...</span>
	<span class="n">mcommoninit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mp</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="n">mp</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">g0</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">runtime_malg</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">nil</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="p">...</span>
	<span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pthread_attr_init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">attr</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">runtime_throw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"pthread_attr_init"</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pthread_attr_setdetachstate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">attr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
		<span class="n">runtime_throw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"pthread_attr_setdetachstate"</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I purposely compacted the function for brevity, as it only serves as a demonstration for a point.
Now, my confusion lies in the line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mp-&gt;g0 = runtime_malg(-1, nil, nil)</code>. It is a piece of code
that allocates memory for a new goroutine. Now I am ok with that, <strong>but</strong> what I do not understand
is that new kernel threads (m’s) are supposed to be pick and run a goroutine from the global 
goroutine pool - that is run an existing one, and not create a new one. Now, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_malg</code>
is given parameters that don’t initialise a new goroutine properly, but still, new memory
is allocated for a new goroutine, and is returned to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mp-&gt;g0</code> from runtime_malg.</p>

<p>Assuming I have not misunderstood something, and I am not mistaken (which is kind of likely), 
this is behavior that could lead to a number of questions and/or problems. For instance,
what happens to the goroutine created by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_malg</code>? Is it killed after the m is assigned
a new goroutine to execute? Is it parked on the goroutine global list? Is it just ignored?
Does it affect the runtime scheduler’s goroutine count? This is the last thing I feel I wanna
clear out regarding gccgo’s runtime.</p>

<h2>gdb</h2>

<p>For this week, I also run the executables created by gccgo through gdb. It was a fertile attempt
that, most of the time, confirmed my findings in the goruntime. It also provided us with some
other nice pieces of information regarding the crashing of goroutines, but also left me with a 
question.</p>

<p>The code in question that I run through gdb is this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="n">package</span> <span class="n">main</span>

<span class="n">import</span> <span class="s">"fmt"</span>

<span class="n">func</span> <span class="nf">say</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="n">string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">func</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"[!!] right before a go statement"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">go</span> <span class="n">say</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"world"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">say</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"hello"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Your very typical hello world like goroutine program. Now, setting a break point in main 
(not the program’s main, that’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.main</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> as far as the runtime is concerned is
 the runtime entry point, in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go-main.c</code>) and running it through gdb yields the following
results:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">Breakpoint 1, main <span class="o">()</span> at ../../../gcc_source/libgo/runtime/go-main.c:52

2: __pthread_total <span class="o">=</span> 1
1: runtime_sched.mcount <span class="o">=</span> 1</code></pre></figure>

<p>Up until now, nothing unexpected. The kernel thread is registered with the runtime scheduler
during its initialisation process in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code> and that’ why the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_sched.mcount</code>
is reported to be zero many times before schedinit is run.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">68 __go_go <span class="o">(</span>mainstart, NULL<span class="o">)</span><span class="p">;</span>
2: __pthread_total <span class="o">=</span> 1

<span class="o">(</span>gdb<span class="o">)</span> display runtime_sched.gcount
3: runtime_sched.gcount <span class="o">=</span> 0</code></pre></figure>

<p>That too is ok, because a new goroutine is registered with the scheduler during the call to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__go_go</code>. Now I am gonna fast forward a bit, to a more interesting point.</p>

<p>Oh my goodness. From a first glance, this seems to be a very serious inconsistency between libpthread and the goruntime.
At this point, the go scheduler reports 3 threads (3 registered threads, that means 
that flow of execution has passed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mcommoninit</code>, the kernel thread initialisation function
which also registers the kernel thread with the runtime_scheduler) whereas libpthread reports 2 threads.</p>

<p><strong>But WAIT! Where are you going? Things are about to get even more interesting!</strong></p>

<p>GDB reports 4 threads. Yes, 4 threads ladies and gentlemen. Now take a look closely.
3 threads are in the same frame, with the one with id 4 being the one currently executed.
And there is also a pattern. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x01da48ec</code> is the value of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eip</code> register for all 3 of them.</p>

<p>That’s one thing that is for certain. Now I already have an idea. Why not change

<p>Apparently, there is still much debugging left to checkout what is really happening.
But we have got some leads in the right direction, that hopefully will lead us to 
finally finding out where the problem lies, and correct it.</p>

<p>Most importantly, in my immediate plans, before iI start playing around with libpthread
is to attempt the same debugging run on the same code, under linux (x86). Seeing as
go is clean on linux, it would provide some clues as to what the expected results 
should be, and where the execution differentiates substantially, a clue
that might be vital to finding the problem.</p>

          <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This week was spent attempting to debug the gccgo runtime via print statements. There were many things
that I gained from this endeavour. The most significant of which, is the fact that I have got a great
deal of information regarding the bootstrapping of a go process. Let’s proceed into presenting this 
week’s findings, shall we?</p>

<h1>Findings</h1>

<h2>The process bootstrapping sequence</h2>

<p>The code that begins a new go-process is conveniently located in a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go-main.c</code>, the most significant
part of which is the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="kt">int</span>
<span class="nf">main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_check</span> <span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_args</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">byte</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_osinit</span> <span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_schedinit</span> <span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="n">__go_go</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mainstart</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_mstart</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">runtime_m</span> <span class="p">());</span>
  <span class="n">abort</span> <span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span>
<span class="nf">mainstart</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">arg</span> <span class="n">__attribute__</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">unused</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">runtime_main</span> <span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The process is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_check</code> runs and registers the os_Args and syscall_Envs as runtime_roots with the garbage collector. I am still investigating what this function exactly is doing, but it seems like some early initialisation of the garbage collector</li>
  <li>Secondly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_args</code> is run. It’s job is to call a specific argument handler for the arguments passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>.</li>
  <li>Thirdly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_osinit</code> is run, whose job is to call the lowlevel _CPU_COUNT function, to get the number of CPUs (in a specific data structure that represents a set of CPUs)</li>
  <li>After that, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code> is run, whose job is to create the very first goroutine (g) and system thread (m), and continues with parsing the command line arguments, and the environment variables. After that it sets the maximum number of cpus that are to be used (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GOMAXPROCS</code>), runs the first goroutine, and does some last pieces of the scheduler’s initialisation.</li>
  <li>Following <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__go_go</code> is run, a function whose purpose is to create a new queue, tell it to execute the function that is passed to it as the first parameter, and then queue the goroutine in the
global ready-to-run goroutine pool.</li>
  <li>Last but not least, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_mstart</code> runs, which seems to be starting te execution of the kernel thread created during <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The very last piece of code that is run (and most probably the most important) is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_main</code>. Remember that this is passed as a parameter to a goroutine created during the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__go_go</code> call, and its job is to mark the goroutine that called it as <em>the main os thread</em>, to initialise the sceduler, and create a goroutine whose job is to release unused memory (from the heap) back to the OS.
It then starts executing the process user defined instructions (the code the programmer run) via a call to a
macro that directs it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__go_init_main</code> in the assembly generated by the compiler.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Runtime_main</code> is also the function that terminates the execution of a go process, with a call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_exit</code>
which seems to be a macro to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code> function.</p>

<h2>Other findings</h2>

<p>During our debugging sessions we found out that the total count of kernel threads that are running in a simple program is at least two.
The first one is the bootstrap M, (the one initialised during the program’s initialisation, inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runtime_schedinit</code>) and at least another one, (I am still invistigating the validity of the following claim) 
created to be used by the garbage collector.</p>

<p>A simple go program such as one doing arithmetic or printing a helloworld like message evidently has no issue
running.
The issues arrise when we use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go statement</code>. With all our debugging messages activated, this is how a simple
go program flows:</p>

<h1>Work for the next week</h1>

<p>I will of course continue to print debug until I have knowledge of the exact flow of execution in the go
runtime. Right now I have very good knowledge of the flow, but there are some things that I need to sort out.
For instance it is not exactly clear to me why we call certain functions, or what they are supposed to be doing at certain parts. After I sort this out,  I also plan to start debugging the libpthread to see what’s libpthreads status
during a hello world like program, and during a goroutine powered program, to get to see if we get
to find something interesting in libpthread (like how many threads does libpthread report against how
many the goruntime reports)</p>
