          <h1>Defining the GNU/Linux distribution</h1>

<p>If you are here, we can safely assume that you already know what a <strong>GNU/Linux software
distribution</strong> is, but for completion’s sake, let’s just define so we all have the same context.</p>

<p>A GNU/Linux distribution is a collection of system and application software, packaged together
by the distribution’s developers, so that they are distributed in a nicely integrated bundle, ready
to be used by users and developers alike. Software typically included in such a distribution
ranges from a compiler toolchain, to the C library, to filesystem utilities to text editors.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, from the existence of several different GNU/Linux distributions, there are 
multiple ways that you could possibly combine all these different applications and their respective
configurations, not to mention that you could include even more specialised software, depending
on the target audience of the distribution (such as multimedia software for a distribution like 
<a href="http://ubuntustudio.org/">Ubuntu Studio</a> or penetration testing tools for a distribution such as
<a href="http://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a>)</p>

<h1>The “f” word</h1>

<p>But even with such a great number of different software collections and their respective configurations
there still may not be one that appeals to your specific needs. That’s ok though, as you can still
customize each and every distribution to your specific liking. Extensive customization is known to
create a <em>differentiation point</em> known as a <strong>potential forking point</strong>.</p>

<p>Forking is a term that has been known to carry negative connotations. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29">As wikipedia puts it</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the term often implies not merely a development branch, but a split in the developer community
a form of schism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Historically, it has also been used as a leverage to coerce a project’s developers 
into merging code into their master branches
that they didn’t originally want to, or otherwise take a decision that they wouldn’t have taken
if not under the pressure of a <em>“fork”</em>. But why is it so?</p>

<p>You see, traditionally, forking a project meant a couple of things: For starters, there were now
two, identical projects, competing in the same solution space. 
Those two projects had different development hours and 
features or bug fixes going into them, and eventually, one of the two ended up being obsolete.
Apart from that forking also created an atmosphere of intense competition among the two projects.</p>

<p>However, in 2014, and the advent of the distributed version control systems such as <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> 
and <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">mercurial</a> and of the social coding websites such as <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> and <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>, the term is finally taking
on a more lax meaning, as just another code repository that may or may not enjoy major 
(or even minor, for that matter) development.</p>

<h2>Forking a GNU/Linux distribution</h2>

<p>So, up until now we have discussed what a GNU/Linux distribution is, and what a fork is. 
However, we haven’t discussed yet what it means to fork a GNU/Linux distribution.</p>

<p>You see, what differentiates each distro from the other ones, apart from the software collection 
that they contain, is the way in which they provide (and deploy) that software. Yes, we are talking about software packages and their respective package managers. Distributions from the Debian
(.deb) family are using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpkg</code> along with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">synaptic</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aptitude</code> or some other higher level
tool. RPM (.rpm) based distributions may use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpm</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yum</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dnf</code> or  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zypper</code> or another higher level tool. 
Other distributions, not based on the aforementioned may choose to roll their own configuration
of packages and package managers, with Arch Linux using its own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pacman</code>, Sabayon uses its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entropy</code>
package manager, etc.</p>

<p>Now, naturally, if you want to customize an application to your liking, you have many ways in which
you could do that. One of them is downloading the tarball from the upstream’s website or ftp 
server, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./configure</code> it and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make install</code> it. But if you do start customizing
lots of applications this way, it can become tedious and unwieldy too soon. After all, what did
that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make install</code> install exactly? Will the new update replace those files? What were your
configuration options? Did they replace the files the package manager installed?</p>

<p>In this case, it really pays off to learn <strong>packaging</strong> software for your distribution of choice.
What this means is to learn the format of packages your distribution’s package manager accepts
as well as how you could produce them. This way, instead of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code> 
cycle, you just have beautiful software packages, that you can control more tightly, you can 
update more easily and you can also distribute them to your friends if you so desire. As an added
bonus, now the package manager also knows about those files, and you can install, remove
or update them much more easily. What’s not to like?</p>

<p>After you have created some custom packages, you may also wish to create a repository
to contain them and update straight from that. <strong>Congratulations, you have created your custom
distribution, and a potential fork.</strong> While you are at it, if you really want to fork the distribution,
you could as well take the distribution’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">base</code> packages, customize them, rebuild them, and then
distribute them. <strong>Congratulations again, now you have your true GNU/Linux distribution fork</strong>.</p>

<h1>That seems easy. More specifically?</h1>

<p>Yes of course. Let’s take a look at how you might want to go about forking some well known
GNU/Linux distribution.</p>

<h2>Debian</h2>

<p>In Debian, your usual procedure if you wish to customize a package is the below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, you make sure you have the essential building software installed. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt-get install build-essential devscripts debhelper</code></li>
  <li>Then you need to download the package’s build dependencies. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt-get build-dep $package_name</code></li>
  <li>Now it’s time to download it’s sources, via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt-get source $package_name</code></li>
  <li>Proceed with customizing it to your liking (update it, patch the sources, etc)</li>
  <li>Now it’s time to rebuild it. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debuild -us -uc</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming all went fine, you should now have an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$package_name.deb</code> file in your current 
directory ready to be installed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpkg -i $package_name.deb</code>.</p>

<p>Please take note that the above is not an extensive treatise into debian packaging by any means.
If you want to build custom debian packages, here are some links:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/IntroDebianPackaging">Debian wiki: intro to Debian packaging</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://people.connexer.com/~roberto/howtos/debcustomize">Roberto C Sanchez: Debian package customization how to</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/HowToPackageForDebian">Debian wiki: How to package for Debian</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you have your custom packages, it’s time to build a repository to contain them. There 
are many tools you can use to do that, including the official debian package archiving tool
known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dak</code>, but if you want a personal repository without too much hassle, it’s better if you
use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reprepro</code>. I won’t go to full length on that here, <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/article/286/Setting_up_your_own_APT_repository_with_upload_support">but instead I will lead you to a very
good guide to do so if you so desire</a></p>

<h2>Fedora</h2>

<p>Building packages for fedora is a procedure similar to the debian one. Fedora however is more
convenient in one aspect: <a href="http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/20/Fedora/source/iso/Fedora-20-source-DVD.iso">It allows you to download a DVD image with all the sources in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.rpm</code> form
ready for you to customize and rebuild to your tastes.</a></p>

<p>Apart from that, the usual procedure is the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRPM</code> (source RPM) via any means. You could do that using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yumdownloader</code> utility, likewise <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yumdownloader $package_name</code>. To use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yumdownloader</code>, you need
to have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yum-utils</code> installed.</li>
  <li>After you have downloaded the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SRPM</code>, next you have to unpack it: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpm -i $package_name</code></li>
  <li>Next up, you customize the package to your liking (patch the sources, etc)</li>
  <li>Finally, you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SPECS</code> folder, and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpmbuild -ba $package.spec</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Again the above mentioned steps may not be 100% correct. If you want to go down this route,
see the following links for more information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/RebuildSRPM">Centos wiki: Rebuild SRPM how-to</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package">Fedora wiki: How to create an RPM package</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Next up, is the repository creation step.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To create a yum repository, you need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yum install createrepo</code>. 
After that you need to create a directory to use as the repository, likewise
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir /var/ftp/repo/Fedora/19/{SRPMS, i386,x86_64)</code>.</li>
  <li>After that you move your i386 packages to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/var/ftp/repo/Fedora/19/i386</code>, and the rest
of the packages to their respective folders.</li>
  <li>Next step is adding a configuration file to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/yum.repos.d/</code> that describes your repository
to yum.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, not definitive, and for more information, take a look at these links:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Arch Linux</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>, at least in comparison to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.deb</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.rpm</code> package
distribution families is very easy to customize to your liking. That’s to be expected though
as Arch Linux is a distribution that sells itself of the customization capabilities it offers to its user.</p>

<p>In essence, if you want to customize a package, the general process is this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download Arch tarball that contains the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PKGBUILD</code> file</li>
  <li>untar the tarball</li>
  <li>(Optional) download the upstream tarball referenced in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PKGBUILD</code>, and modify it
 to your liking</li>
  <li>run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makepkg</code> in the folder containing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PKGBUILD</code></li>
  <li>install (using pacman) the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.xz</code> file produced after the whole process is finished.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to download the official {core | extra | community} packages, you need to run as root
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abs</code>. This will create a directory tree that contains the files required for building any package 
in the official repositories.</p>

<p>Next up, you can create a custom local repository with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repo-add</code> tool, and then proceeding
with editing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/pacman.conf</code> and adding an entry for your repository there. For more information:</p>

<h1>To fork or not to fork?</h1>

<p>Well, that’s not an easy question to answer. My opinion is that it’s extremely educational to
do a <strong><em>soft</em></strong> fork, clone the distribution’s core repository, and for some time maintain your own
distribution based on it, that is, update and customize all the repositories. Do that for some months,
then go back to using your distribution of choice now that you are enlightened with how it works
under the hood. The reason this is very educational is that it will teach you the ins and outs of
your distribution, teach you about <strong>all</strong> the software in it, how it integrates, what its role is.
It will teach you packaging which is a tremendously undervalued skill, as you can customize
your experience to your liking, and it will make you appreciate the effort going into maintaining
the distribution.</p>

<p>As for doing a <strong>hard</strong> fork, that is creating your own distribution, that you commit to maintaining
it for a long time, my opinion is that it’s simply not worth it. Maintaining a distribution, be it
by yourself, or with your friends, is a tremendous amount of work, that’s not worth it unless
you have other goals you want to achieve by that. If all you want to do is to customize your 
distribution of choice to your liking, then go ahead, learn packaging for it, customize-package
the applications you want, then create your own repo - but always track the upstream. Diverging
too much from the upstream is not worth the hassle, as you will end up spending more time
maintaining than using the distribution in the end.</p>

<h2>tl;dr:</h2>

<p>If you want to do a small scale, private fork in order to see what’s under the hood of your Linux
distro; by all means go ahead.</p>

<p>If you want to do a large scale, public fork, then take your time to calculate the effort, if it’s worth it,
and if you could just help the upstream distribution implement the features you want.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>In the last part of this series, we talked about the compiler’s composition, including the assembler
and the linker. We showed what happens when the compiler runs, and what’s the output
of translation software such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cc1</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as</code> etc. In this final part of the series, we are going
to talk about the C library, how our programs interface with it, and how it interfaces with 
the kernel.</p>

<h1>The C Standard Library</h1>

<p>The C Standard Library is pretty much a part of every UNIX like operating system. It’s basically
a collection of code, including functions, macros, type definitions etc, in order to provide facilities
such as string handling (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string.h</code>), mathematical computations (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">math.h</code>), input and output
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdio.h</code>), etc.</p>

<p>GNU/Linux operating systems are generally using the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library implementation(GLIBC)</a>,
but it’s common to find other C libraries being used (especially in embedded systems) such as 
<a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibC</a>, <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/newlib">newlib</a>, or in the case
of Android/Linux systems <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic.git">Bionic</a>.
BSD style operating systems usually have their own implementation of a C library.</p>

<h2>So, how does one “use” the C Standard Library?</h2>

<p>So, now that we are acquainted with the C Library, how do you make use of it, you ask? The answer is:
<strong>automagically</strong> :). Hold on right there; that’s not exactly a hyperbole. You see, when you
write a basic C program, you usually <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#include &lt;some_header.h&gt;</code> and then continue with
using the code declared in that header. We have explained in the previous part of this series
that when we use a function, say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printf()</code>, in reality it’s the linker that does the hard work 
and allows us to use this function, by linking our program against the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libc</code>’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">so</code> (shared 
object). So in essence, when you need to use the C Standard Library, you just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#include</code>
headers that belong to it, and the linker will resolve the references to the code included.</p>

<p>Apart from the functions that are defined in the Standards however, a C Library might also
implement further functionality. For example, the Standards don’t say anything about networking.
As a matter of fact, most libraries today may implement not only what’s in the C Standards,
but may also choose to comply with the requirements of the POSIX C library, which is a superset
of the C Standard library.</p>

<h2>Ok, and how does the C Library manage to provide these services?</h2>

<p>The answer to this question is simple: Some of the services that the library provides, it does so
without needing any sort of special privileges, being normal, userspace C code, while others
need to ask the Operating’s system Kernel to provide these facilities for the library.</p>

<p>How does it do so? By calling some functions exported by the kernel to provide certain functionality
 named <strong>system calls</strong>. System calls are the fundamental interface between a userspace
application and the Operating System Kernel. For example consider this:</p>

<p>You might have a program that has code like this at one point: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fd = open("log.txt", "w+");</code>. That
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open</code> function is provided by the C Library, but the C Library itself can not execute all of the
functionality that’s required to open a file, so it may call a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sys_open()</code> system call that will
ask the kernel to do what’s required to load the file. In this case we say that the library’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open</code>
call acts as a wrapper function of the system call.</p>

<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p>In this final part of our series, we saw how our applications interface with the C Standard Library
available in our system, and how the Library itself interfaces with the Operating system kernel
to provide the required services needed by the userspace applications.</p>

          <h1>xv6: An introduction</h1>

<p>If you are like me, a low level pc programmer, it’s hard not to have heard
of <strong>xv6</strong>. <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html">xv6</a>, for those
who haven’t really heard of it, is a <em>UNIX version 6</em> clone, designed
at MIT to help teach operating systems.</p>

<p>The reasoning behind doing this was fairly simple: <a href="http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/Lions/">Up until that point, MIT
had used John Lions’ famous commentary on the Sixth Edition of UNIX</a>. But V6 was challenging due to a 
number of reasons. To begin with, it was written in a near ancient version
of C (pre K&amp;R), and apart from that, it contained PDP-11 assembly
(a legendary machine for us UNIX lovers, but ancient nonetheless), which
didn’t really help the students that had to study both PDP-11 and the
(more common) x86 architecture to develop another (exokernel) operating
system on.</p>

<p>So, to make things much more simpler, professors there decided to 
roll with a clone of UNIX version 6, that was x86 specific, 
written in ANSI C and supported multiprocessor machines.</p>

<p>For a student (or a programmer interested in operating systems), xv6 is 
a unique opportunity to introduce himself to kernel hacking and to the
architecture of UNIX like systems. At about 15k lines of code (iirc), 
including the (primitive) libraries, the userland and the kernel,
it’s very easy (or well, at least easier than production scale UNIX like
systems) to grok, and it’s also very easy to expand on. It also helps
tremendously that xv6 as a whole has magnificent documentation, not only
from MIT, but from other universities that have adopted xv6 for use in their
operating systems syllabus.</p>

<h2>An introduction to Ensidia: my very personal xv6 fork</h2>

<p>When I first discovered xv6 I was ecstatic. For the reasons mentioned above
I couldn’t lose on the opportunity to fork xv6 and use it as a personal
testbed for anything I could feel like exploring or testing out.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, when I first discovered xv6, <a href="https://github.com/NlightNFotis/Fotix">I had just finished 
implementing (the base of) my own UNIX like operating system, named fotix</a>, 
and the timing of my discovery was great. xv6 had done what I had done,
and also implemented most of what I was planning to work on fotix
(for example, elf file loading), and it was a solid base for further 
development. It also had a userland, which fotix at the time didn’t have.</p>

<p>After I forked xv6, I spent some time familiriazing myself with the code.
I also cleaned up the source code quite a bit, structuring the code in a 
BSD like folder structure, instead of having all of the code in the same 
folder and made various small scale changes.</p>

<p>After that for quite some time, I had left ensidia alone and didn’t touch
it much. However, I always felt like I wanted to develop it a bit more
and get to play with its code in interesting ways. I was trying to think of
a great way to get started with kernel hacking on it, in a simple way, to 
get more acquainted with the kernel, and found an interesting pdf with 
interesting project ideas for it. One of them was to add a system call.
I figured out that would be an interesting and quick hack, so hey, why not?</p>

<h1>Getting started with kernel hacking on xv6: Adding the system call.</h1>

<p>The system call I decided to introduce was the suggested one. It was
fairly simple sounding too. You have to <strong>introduce a new system call
that returns the number of total system calls that have taken place
so far</strong>. So let’s see how I went about implementing it:</p>

<h2>An introduction to system calls in xv6</h2>

<p>First of all, we should provide some context about what system calls are,
how they are used, and how they are implemented in xv6.</p>

<p>A system call is a function that a userspace application will use, so as
to ask for a specific service to be provided by the operating system. For
instance with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sbrk(n)</code> system call, a process can ask the kernel to
grow its heap space by n bytes. Another example is the well known <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fork()</code>
system call in the UNIX world, that’s used to create a new process by 
cloning the caller process.</p>

<p>The way applications signal the kernel that they need that service is
by issueing a software <em>interrupt</em>. An <em>interrupt</em> is a signal generated
that notifies the processor that it needs to stop what its currently doing,
and handle the interrupt. This mechanism is also used to notify the processor
that information it was seeking from the disks is in some buffer, ready to
be extracted and processed, or, that a key was pressed in the keyboard. This
is called a hardware interrupt.</p>

<p>Before the processor stops to handle the interrupt generated, it needs to 
save the current state, so that it can resume the execution in this context
after the interrupt has been handled.</p>

<p>The code that calls a system call in xv6 looks like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-gas" data-lang="gas"># exec(init, argv)
 .globl start
 start:
   pushl $argv
   pushl $init
   pushl $0  // where caller pc would be
   movl $SYS_exec, %eax
   int $T_SYSCALL</code></pre></figure>

<p>In essence, it pushes the argument of the call to the stack, and puts
the system call number (in the above code, that’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$SYS_exec</code>) into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%eax</code>.
The number is used to match the entry in an array that holds pointers to
all the system calls. After that, it generates a software interrupt, with
a code (in this case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$T_SYSCALL</code>) that’s used to index the interrupt
descriptor tables and find the appropriate interrupt handler.</p>

<p>The code that is specific to find the appropriate interrupt handler is
called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trap()</code> and is available in the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trap.c</code>. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trap()</code> check’s
out the trapnumber in the generated trapframe (a structure that represents
the processor’s state at the time that the trap happened) to be equal to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T_SYSCALL</code>, it calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syscall()</code> (the software interrupt handler)
 that’s available in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syscall.c</code></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="c1">// This is the part of trap that</span>
<span class="c1">// calls syscall()</span>
<span class="kt">void</span>
<span class="nf">trap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">trapframe</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">tf</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tf</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">trapno</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">T_SYSCALL</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">killed</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="n">exit</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">tf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tf</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">syscall</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">killed</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="n">exit</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syscall()</code> is finally the function that checks out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%eax</code> to get the 
number of the system call (to index the array with the system 
call pointers), and execute the code corresponding to that system call.</p>

<p>The implementation of system calls in xv6 is under two files. The first one
is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sysproc.c</code>, and is the one containing the implementation of system calls
correspondent to processes, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sysfile.c</code> that contains the implementation
of system calls regarding the file system.</p>

<h2>The specific implementation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numcalls()</code> system call</h2>

<p>To implement the system call itself is simple. I did so with a global variable
in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syscall.c</code> called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syscallnum</code>, that’s incremented everytime 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syscall()</code>, calls a system call function, that is, the system call
is valid.</p>

<p>Next we just need a function, the system call implementation that returns
that number to the userspace program that asks for it. Below is the 
function itself, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syscall()</code> after our change.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="c1">// return the number of system calls that have taken place in</span>
<span class="c1">// the system</span>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After that was done, the next few things that were needed to be done
were fairly straight forward. We had to add an index number for the new
system call in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syscall.h</code>, expose it to user proccesses via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user.h</code>,
and add a new macro to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usys.S</code> that defines an asm routine that calls
that specific system call, and change the makefile to facilitate our change
. After doing so we had to write a userspace testing program to test our changes.</p>

<p>The result after doing all this is below :)</p>

<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p>I usually end my blog posts with an epilogue. Although this is a post
that doesn’t necesarilly need one, <strong>I wanted to write one just to say to you
that you should try kernel hacking</strong>, <em>that is programming jargon for
programming an operating system kernel</em>, because it’s an experience that
undoubtedly will teach you a great deal of things about how your computer
actually works.</p>

<p>Last but not least, take a look at the ongoing work on <a href="https://github.com/NlightNFotis/Ensidia">Ensidia, my fork
of xv6</a>. To see this particular
work, take a look at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syscall</code> branch.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>In the previous part of this little series, we talked about the compiler, and what it does 
with the header files, in our attempt to demistify their usage. In this part, I want to show you
what’s the compiler’s output, and how we create our file.</p>

<h1>The compiler’s composition</h1>

<p>Generally speaking, a <em>compiler</em> belongs to a family of software called <strong>translators</strong>. 
A translator’s job is to read some source code in a source language, and generate (translate it to) 
some source code in a target language.</p>

<p>Now, you might think that most compilers you know don’t do that. You input a (source code) file, 
and you get a binary file, ready to run when you want it to. Yes that’s what it does, but it’s not
the compiler that does all this. If you remember from the last installment of this series,
when you call the compiler like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc some_file.c</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clang some_file.c</code>, in essence you are
calling the compilation driver, with the file as a parameter. The compilation driver then calls
1) the preprocessor, 2) the (actual) compiler, 3) the assembler and last but not least the linker.
At least when it comes to gcc, these pieces of software are called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cpp</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cc1</code>, 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gas</code> (executable name is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as</code>)  and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collect2</code> (executable name is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ld</code>) respectively.</p>

<p>From that little software collection up top, that we call the compiler, we can easily take notice
of at least 3 (yeah, that’s right) translators, that act as we mentioned earlier, 
that is take some input in a source language, and produce some output to a target language.</p>

<p>The first is the preprocessor. The preprocessor accepts source code in C as a source language,
and produces source code again in C (as a target language), but with the output having various
elements of the source code resolved, such as header file inclusion, macro expansion, etc.</p>

<p>The second is the compiler. The compiler accepts (in our case) C source code, as a source language,
and translates it to some architecture’s assembly language. In my case, when I talk about the 
compiler, I’m gonna assume that it produces x86 assembly.</p>

<p>The last one, is the assembler, which accepts as input some machine’s architecture assembly
language, and produces what’s called binary, or object representation of it, that is it translates
the assembly mnemonics directly to the bytes they correspond to, in the target architecture.</p>

<p>At this point, one could also argue that the linker is also a translator, accepting binary, and 
translating it to an executable file, that is, resolving references, and fitting the binary code
on the segments of the file that is to be produced. For example, on a typical GNU/Linux system,
this phase produces the executable ELF file.</p>

<h1>The (actual) compiler’s output: x86 assembly.</h1>

<p>Before we go any further, I would like to show you what the compiler really creates:</p>

<p>For the typical hello world program we demonstrated in our first installment, the compiler
will output the following assembly code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-gas" data-lang="gas">	.file	"hello.c"
	.section	.rodata
.LC0:
	.string	"Hello world!"
	.text
	.globl	main
	.type	main, @function
main:
	pushq	%rbp
	movq	%rsp, %rbp
	subq	$16, %rsp
	movl	%edi, -4(%rbp)
	movq	%rsi, -16(%rbp)
	movl	$.LC0, %edi
	call	puts
	movl	$0, %eax
	leave
	ret
	.size	main, .-main
	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) 4.8.2 20131212 (Red Hat 4.8.2-7)"
	.section	.note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits</code></pre></figure>

<p>To produce the above file, we had to use the following gcc invocation command:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc -S -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -o hello.S hello.c</code>. 
We used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables</code> to remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.cfi</code> directives, which tell <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gas</code> 
(the gnu assembler) to emit Dwarf Call Frame Information tags, which are used to reconstruct
a stack backtrace when a frame pointer is missing.</p>

<p>For more usefull compilation flags, to control the intermediary compilation flow, try these:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-E</code>: stop after preprocessing, and produce a *.i file</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-S</code>: we used this, stop after the compiler, and produce a *.s file</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-c</code>: stop after the assembler, and produce a *.o file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default behaviour is to use none, and stop after the linker has run. If you want to run a 
full compilation and keep all the intermediate files, use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-save-temps</code> flag.</p>

<h1>From source to binary: the assembler.</h1>

<p>The next part of the compilation process, is the assembler. We have already discussed what
the assembler does, so here we are going to see it in practice. If you have followed so far,
you should have two files, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello.c</code>, which is the hello world’s C source code file,
and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello.S</code> which is what we created earlier, the compiler’s (x86) assembly output.</p>

<p>The assembler operates on that last file as you can imagine, and to see it running, and emit
binary, we need to invoke it like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as -o hello.bin hello.S</code>, and produces this:</p>

<h1>Last but not least: the linker</h1>

<p>We saw what the assembler emits, which is to say, binary code. However, that binary code
still needs further processing. To explain that, we need to go back a little.</p>

<p>In our first installment of the series, we said that when you call a function like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printf()</code>,
the compiler only needs its prototype to do type checking and ensure that you use it legally.
For that you include the header file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdio.h</code>. But since that contains the function prototype only,
where is the source code for that function? Surely, it must be somewhere, since it executes 
successfully to begin with, but we haven’t met the source code for printf so far, so where is it?</p>

<p>The function’s source code is located in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.so</code> (shared object) of the standard C library,
which in my system (Fedora 19, x64) is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libc-2.17.so</code>. I don’t want to expand on that further,
as I plan to do so on the next series installment, however, what we have said so far is enough
for you to understand the linker’s usage:</p>

<p>The linker resolves the undefined (thus far) reference to printf, by finding the reference to
the printf symbol and (in layman’s talk) 
making a pointer to point to it so that execution can jump to printf’s code
when we have to do that during our program’s execution.</p>

<p>To invoke the linker on our file, <a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.20/ld/Options.html#Options">at least according to it’s documentation</a>, 
we should do the following: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ld -o hello.out /lib/crt0.o hello.bin -lc</code>. Then we should
be able to run the file like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./hello.out</code>.</p>

<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p>That’s this end of this part 2 of my series that explains how your code turns into binary, and how
your computer (at least when it comes to the software side) runs it. In part 3, I am going to discuss
in greater length, the C library, and the kernel.</p>

          <p>The past two to three days, I have been busy with creating my very own Linux distribution
using the well known <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org">Linux from Scratch</a>. This post is 
an accounting of my experience with the process, what I liked, what I did learn from that,
what was surprising to me and more.</p>

<h1>Linux from Scratch: An introduction</h1>

<p>If you are here, then you most likely already know what <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.com/">linux from scratch</a>
is, but for the sake of completeness (or in the case that you don’t know what it is, but are
so keen on learning)  I will provide an introduction about it here.</p>

<p>Linux from scratch is a book (from now on, <em>lfs</em>), providing a series of steps that guide you to the creation of
a fully function GNU/Linux distribution. Although the original book creates a “barebones”
distribution, with only fundamental tools in it, the distribution created provides a fine
enviroment for further experimentation or customization.</p>

<p>Apart from the basic book, the lfs project also has 3-4 books to read if you want to extend
the basic system (such as blfs, Beyond Linux from Scratch) or if you want to automate the process,
create a distribution that is more secure, or how to cross-compile an lfs system for different machines.</p>

<h1>My experience with building LFS</h1>

<h2>A small introduction about my background</h2>

<p>I have been a UNIX (-like) systems (full-time) user for about 2.5 years now. During that time
I had seen myself from being what you would call a Linux newbie, not knowing how to use
a system without a GUI installed (have I mentioned that Ubuntu was my favourite distribution) to being an arguably experienced UNIX programmer, trying to learn more about the
various aspects of UNIX systems, and delving deeper and deeper into them every day
(while also feeling pain if using something other than a UNIX like system).</p>

<p>During that time, I have learned about the Unix way of working with the system, using the shell and the system’s toolchain to write software and other wise manipulate the system. I
ditched my old knowledge about IDEs and GUIs, and set out to master the command line and the associated tools (Anecdote: I remember, when I first came from to Unix from Windows, to searching the net for a C/C++ IDE to do development.) I remember reading about
how people worked another way in Unix land, using an editor, and the shell to work, and I 
decided to force myself to learn to work that way. I still remember trying to use vim and gcc, 
and ending up liking this way better because it seemed a more natural way to interact with
the software development process, than using a ide and pressing the equivalent of a “play”
button, so that magic ensues for the next few seconds until I have a result.</p>

<p>Time has passed since then, and going through hours and hours of reading and working with
the system, I did learn quite a lot about it. My Google Summer of Code experience in 2013
expanded my system knowledge even further (that’s what you get when you have to work
with the system kernel, the C library and a compiler).</p>

<p>But in all that time, of using Unix like systems, I never had the chance to create one myself.
And although my background did allow me to know quite a few things of the inner workings
of a system like that, I never actually saw all these software systems combining in front
of my very eyes to create that beauty we know as a GNU/Linux distribution. And that left
me a bad taste, because I knew what was happening, but I wanted to see it happen right 
in front of my eyes.</p>

<p>Knowing about the existence of lfs, and not actually going through it also made matters worse
for me, as I knew that I could actually “patch” that knowledge gap of mine, but I never really
tried to do that. I felt that I was missing on a lot, and that lfs would be instrumental to my
understanding of a Linux system. Having gone through that some years ago, and getting
stuck at the very beginning had also created an innate fear in me, that it was something
that would be above my own powers.</p>

<p>Until two days ago, when I said to myself: “You know what? I have seen and done a lot 
of things in a UNIX system. I am now much more experienced than I was when I last did it.
And I know I want to at least try it, even if it will only give me nothing but infinite confusion 
Because if I do manage to get it, I will learn so many more things, or at least get assured
that my preexisting knowledge was correct” And that thought was the greatest motive I had
to do that in a fairly long time.</p>

<p>So, I sat at my desk, grabbed a cup of coffee and off I went!</p>

<h2>The process</h2>

<h3>Preparation and the temporary toolchain</h3>

<p>The book is itself several chapters long, each of which perform another “big step” in the
creation of the distribution.</p>

<p>The first few chapters are preparatory chapters, where you ensure the integrity of the 
building environment, and download any building dependencies you may be lacking,
create a new partition that will host the lfs system, and create the user account that
will do the building of the temporary toolchain.</p>

<p>The temporary toolchain building is a more exciting process. In essence
you compile and collect several pieces of software that will later be used
to compile the distribution’s toolchain and other software.</p>

<p>You start of with building binutils, and that is to get a working assembler and linker. 
After having a working assembler and linker, you proceed with compiling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc</code>.
Next on is unpacking the linux headers, so that you can compile (and link against them)
the glibc.</p>

<p>Having the basic parts of the toolchain compiled, you then proceed with installing other
software that is needed in the temporary toolchain, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gawk</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">patch</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perl</code>
etc.</p>

<h3>Building the main system</h3>

<p>After getting done with the temporary toolchain, you then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chroot</code> into the lfs partition.
You start of with creating the needed directories (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/boot</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home</code> etc)
and then continue with building the distribution software, utilising the temporary toolchain.
For instance, you construct a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gcc</code>, you compile <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bzip</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shadow</code>
utility that manages the handling of passwords etc, all while making sure that things don’t
break, and running countless tests (that sometimes take longer than what the package
took to compile) to ensure that what you build is functional and reliable.</p>

<h3>Final configuration</h3>

<p>Next one on the list, is the various configuration files that reside in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc</code>, and the setup
of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sysvinit</code>, the distribution’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init</code> system.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, you are compiling the linux kernel and setting up grub so that the
system is bootable.</p>

<p>At this point, if all has gone well, and you reset, you should boot into your new lfs system.</p>

<h1>What did I gain from that?</h1>

<p>Building lfs was a very time consuming process for me. It must have taken about 7-8
hours at the very least. Not so much because of the compilation and testing (I was compiling
with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAKEFLAGS='-j 4'</code> on a Core i5), but because I didn’t complete some steps
correctly, and later needed to go back and redo them, along with everything that followed and the time it took to research some issues, programs or various other things
before I did issue a command at the shell.</p>

<p>Now if I were to answer the question “What did I gain from that”, my answer would be
along the lines of “Infinite confusion, and some great insight at some points”.</p>

<p>To elaborate on that,</p>

<ul>
  <li>lfs mostly served as a reassurance that indeed, what I did know
about the system was mostly correct.</li>
  <li>I did have the chance to see the distribution
get built right before my eyes, which was something I longed for a great amount of time.</li>
  <li>It did make me somewhat more familiar with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code>
cycle</li>
  <li>It made me realise that the directories in the system are the simple result of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> command, and that configuration files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/folder</code> are handwritten plain files. (<em>yeah, I feel stupid about that one - I don’t know what I was expecting.</em> This was probably the result of the “magic involved” that the distro making process entailed for me)</li>
  <li>I got to see the specific software that is needed to create a distribution, and demonstrate to me how I can build it, customize that build, or even change that software to my liking</li>
  <li>And last but not least, something that nearly every lfs user says after a successful try:
I knew that package managers did a great many things in order to maintain the system, and that much
of the work I would normally have to do was done nearly automatically 
but boy, was I underestimating them. After lfs, I developed a new appreciation for a
good package manager.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p><em>Lfs was, for the most part, a great experience.</em> <strong>As a knowledge expander, it works great.</strong>
<strong>As a system that you keep and continue to maintain? I don’t know.</strong> I know that people have
done that in the past, but I decided against maintaining my build, as I figured it would be
very time consuming, and that if I ever wanted to gain the experience of maintaining a distro,
I would probably fork something like <a href="http://www.crux.nu">Crux</a>.</p>

<p>In the end if you ask me if I can recommend that to you, I will say that I’m not so sure.
<strong>It will provide you with some insight into the internals of a GNU/Linux distribution, but it 
won’t make you a better programmer as some people claim</strong> (most of the process revolves
around the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code> cycle, and some conf files handwriting).</p>

<p><strong>In the end, it is yourself who you should ask. Do you want that knowledge? Is it worth the hassle for you?
Do you want the bragging rights? Are you crazy enough to want to maintain it?</strong> 
<em>These are all questions that you get as many answers to them as the people you ask.</em></p>
