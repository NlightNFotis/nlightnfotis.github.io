Wow, what a journey this has been!

Yesterday, Wednesday 11th of May, was the final project presentations for committed
listeners in MIT's synthetic biology course,
[How To Grow (Almost) Anything](https://htgaa2022.notion.site/htgaa2022/HTGAA-2022-d39e5560ad83483ab87d415f085b60c6),
class of 2022.

When I started the course, sometime in the end of January, I had no idea what a blast
this would be (nor did I have any idea of how much pressure this would apply on me, but
hey, I survived this, and then some üòÅ ).

I credit this class with taking me from rudimentary biology knowledge, to a fairly solid
understanding of molecular biology and immunology, all in about 3-4 months.

As you can probably imagine, this was... intense.

But before I dive more into the experience and what I learnt in this course, let me
give some background into the course and the context of my participation.

Anyone who knows me is aware of my awe at the potential of synthetic biology. As a
matter of fact, I think this is going to be the next exponential growth sector after
the computer industry. The field itself is fairly nascent, but it's going to pick
up the pace in the next 5-10 years. And although I believe that all its subdomains
hold massive potential, I'm especially keen on synthetic biology applications in
human therapeutics.

Now, I keep it no secret that I want to found a synthetic biology company in the
(hopefully, not so distant) future.

With that bit of information, you may guess that in general I was observant
of any opportunities to dive deeper into the field.

With that in mind (along with a hefty bit of luck - fate? üòÅ ), I came across a
tweet by the organiser of the course, [David Kong](https://twitter.com/davidsunkong),
advertising the course, along with the fact that this year it would admit a small
cohort of students who want to attend remotely.

Wasting no time, I shot an email towards David, and was surprised when I got an
email a couple days later admitting me to the course, and sharing zoom links for
the course's first lecture.

## The Attendance Experience

The course was setup in a set of two classes per week:

* one three-hour lecture, in which the first hour was spent reviewing homework
  from last week, and the next two hours had different presenters give presentations
  on various topics in synthetic biology, and
* a two-hour class the next day, that included a recitation session - which was
  previewing the homework, for next week - along with a homework review for
  us online listeners.

To my surprise, there was a relatively high number of online students participating
(~ 45, IIRC - about 3 times the number of MIT students physically attending), but
only about a third of the online students made it through to the end.

Attendance was taken every lecture, for both us (online listeners) and the
students physically present at MIT. We were also expected to do all the exercises
for the week - with the TAs making sure that this was the case.

In the middle of the course's duration, we also had a handful of hands-on workshops
(of which we had to attend some), aptly named the *Festival of Growing*.

## The Lectures

The course was setup around a number of themes (therapeutics, biofabrication/biomaterials,
DNA/RNA editing, microfluidics, etc), and every week we had two-three different presenters
(which ranged from university professors to company CEOs) present on the topic at hand.

The first couple of weeks were around teaching the foundations of molecular biology
(but in a very, *very* accelerated manner), and then the following weeks assumed that
as established knowledge and built on top of that in terms of presenting the state of
the art in applications in various domains.

For the MIT/Harvard students, most of these lectures were also followed by a lab
component. For online listeners, we would partially follow along those processes (given
the lack of wet lab access for some of us), or, at other times, we would be given
substitute exercises that involved using online tools (such as [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/)
to simulate the in-vitro experiments in-silico.
