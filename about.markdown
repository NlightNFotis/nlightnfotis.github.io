I am Fotis Koutoulakis, a software engineer at [Diffblue](https://www.diffblue.com)'s
open source team, working on maintaining [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc).

My primary interests in Computer Science relate to Programming Language Theory and
Implementation, spilling of course into related subjects such as software reliability
and verification, functional programming, etc.

Outside of computers, my interests are multidisciplinary and they lie across Mathematics,
Biology, Economics, Cognitive Science and Philosophy.

I also spend time playing various assortments of musical instruments (Piano, Guitar
and Vocals) at various levels of expertise, and I'm also keen in improving every
facet of my life.

This blog is for me to share interesting things I've learnt, implemented or thought.
