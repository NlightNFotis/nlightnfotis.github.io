I am Fotis Koutoulakis (Φώτης Κουτουλάκης, in Greek), a Greek Scientist and Engineer
residing in Oxford, England.

I am currently working as a software engineer at [Diffblue](https://www.diffblue.com)'s
open source team, working on maintaining [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc).

My primary background in Computer Science is PLT (Programming Language Theory). I have
also expanded into adjacent fields (Software Verification, Formal Methods, etc).

My programming experience lies across multiple different languages, but I mostly prefer
*functional programming*. I am especially fond of Lisp-like (especially Racket) languages
and languages of the ML family (OCaml, F#, etc.).

Outside of computers, my interests are multidisciplinary and they lie across Mathematics,
Biology, Economics, Cognitive Science and Philosophy.

I also spend time playing various assortments of musical instruments (Piano, Guitar
and Vocals) at various levels of expertise, and I'm also keen on quantified-self and
personal-development (across all facets of my life).

## The Blog

This blog is for me to share interesting things I've learnt, implemented or thought.

It's not strictly related to computers (even though that will probably be most of what
I'm sharing here), and you may on occassions find some rudimentary philosophical essays,
mathematical observations, etc.

The blog is named after the *lambda calculus*, a model of computation that's close to
my heart and study of which has gotten me a great many pleasant memories of myself and
computing science.
