I am Fotis Koutoulakis (Φώτης Κουτουλάκης, in Greek), a Computer Scientist,
Engineer and Mathematician residing in Oxford, England.

*I am currently open to employment opportunities*.

Most recently I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Diffblue](https://www.diffblue.com)'s
open source team, where I was working on maintaining [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc).
My day to day work was in C++ and Rust.

My primary background in Computer Science is PLT (Programming Language Theory). I have
also expanded into adjacent fields (Software Verification, Formal Methods, etc).

My programming experience lies across many different programming languages and paradigms,
but I mostly prefer *functional programming*. I am at my happiest though when I'm working
with Rust, Ruby or F#/OCaml.

Outside of computers, my interests are multidisciplinary and they lie across Mathematics,
Biology, Economics, Cognitive Science and Philosophy.

I also spend time playing various assortments of musical instruments (Piano, Guitar
and Vocals) at various levels of expertise, and I'm also keen on quantified-self and
personal-development (across all facets of my life).

## The Blog

The blog was created with the following ends in mind:

1. Document and share my knowledge and opinions.
2. Improve my writing and communication skills.
3. Reach and connect with people who share my interests.

It's not strictly related to computers (even though that will probably be most of what
I'm sharing here), and you may on occasions find some rudimentary philosophical essays,
mathematical observations, etc.

The blog is named after the *lambda calculus*, a model of computation that's close to
my heart and study of which has gotten me a great many pleasant memories of myself and
computing science.
