# Who am I?

My name is **Fotis Koutoulakis**. You may also know me as **NlightNFotis** or **nlightnfotis**.
I am a young (currently 22 years old) Computer Scientist from Greece.

My primary computer science interest lies in systems software and its engineering, 
such as **Compilers, Operating Systems, Virtual Machines, Programming languages, Debuggers, etc**, but of them all
I am mostly interested in programming languages and their implementations.

Secondary interests are algorithms and computer security (with an emphasis on reverse engineering).

I am also a User and Developer of Free Software. In my "free" time I am working towards understanding
and contributing to programming language implementations and compilers, with llvm occupying most of that time.

Regarding my career plans, I would like to work as either a **research computer scientist on programming languages** 
or a **compiler engineer**. I would also be happy with working on an operating system.

# CV

I maintain an online CV at stack overflow careers which you may find [here](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/FotisKoutoulakis).

# Current Occupation

I am not working anywhere at the moment.

# Past Occupations

I have worked as a Google Summer of Code 2013 intern tasked with fully porting gccgo (the [Go language](http://golang.org) frontend for gcc) ([Link in the GCC wiki](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode#A2013)).
and the rest of the infrastructure required to allow software written on Go to be correctly executed on the Hurd. 
You may find more information on my [original project proposal](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/nlightnfotis/1), or under the gsoc tag in the blog posts.
