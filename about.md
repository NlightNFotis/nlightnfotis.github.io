# Who am I?

My name is **Fotis Koutoulakis**. You may also know me as **NlightNFotis** or **nlightnfotis**.
I am a young (currently 21 years old) Computer Scientist from Greece.

Regarding my computer science adventures, I am mostly interested in anything that has to do with computer 
infrastructure, such as **Compilers, Operating Systems, Virtual Machines, Programming languages,
and the like**. 

I am also a User and Developer of Free Software. I am contributing to [cPython](http://www.python.org),
and I am also working towards understanding and contributing to a compiler infrastructure project such as [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org) (The GNU Compiler Collection)
or [LLVM](http://www.llvm.org).

Regarding my career plans, I am hoping to work as either a **kernel hacker** or a **compiler engineer** (or both. That sounds better :) )

# CV

I maintain an online CV at stack overflow careers which you may find [here](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/FotisKoutoulakis). 

My Stack Overflow profile can be found here: [NlightNFotis at Stack Overflow, Q&amp;A for professional and enthusiast programmers](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1426969/nlightnfotis)

# Current Occupation

I am not working anywhere at the moment.

# Past Occupations

I have worked as a Google Summer of Code 2013 intern tasked with fully porting gccgo (the [Go language](http://golang.org) frontend for gcc) ([Link in the GCC wiki](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode#A2013)).
and the rest of the infrastructure required to allow software written on Go to be correctly executed on the Hurd. 
You may find more information on my [original project proposal](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/nlightnfotis/1), or under the gsoc tag in the blog posts.
