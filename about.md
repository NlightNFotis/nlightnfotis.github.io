I am Fotis Koutoulakis (Φώτης Κουτουλάκης, in Greek), a *Polymath* living and working
at Oxford, England.

### Work 👨🏻‍💻💸

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at GitHub, working on [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com)
and related infrastructure.

Before that I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Diffblue](https://www.diffblue.com)'s
open source team, where I was working on maintaining [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc).

With regards to programming languages and tools, most of my experience has been
in software reliability and security, working with C++ and Rust. However, as a
software engineer I'm pretty agnostic as to what language I use, having significant
experience in languages spanning from Racket and Haskell, to C#, Python and TypeScript.

These days I mostly find myself enjoying F# and Ruby in my personal projects,
with Java and TypeScript being the ones I use most at work.

## The Blog

The blog was created with the following ends in mind:

1. Document and share my knowledge and opinions.
2. Improve my writing and communication skills.
3. Reach and connect with people who share my interests.

It's not strictly related to computers (even though that will probably be most of what
I'm sharing here), and you may on occasions find some rudimentary philosophical essays,
mathematical observations, etc.

The blog is named after the *lambda calculus*, a model of computation that's close to
my heart and study of which has gotten me a great many pleasant memories of myself and
computing science.
