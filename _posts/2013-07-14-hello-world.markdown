# A new beginning

Oh boy! A new start. Isn't that exciting? You bet it is. It's not however
my first introduction to blogging. I used to have a [blog](http://lambdareflection.wordpress.com)
on Wordpress.com, but after a while I was turned off by the fact that it felt too limited.
So I decided I wanted a new place for me to host my online presence, that wasn't so much limited as Wordpress was.
Initially I was thinking about renting a VPS and self hosting wordpress there. But after doing a little research,
I came across [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). I started investigating 
Github pages some more, and found [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to be very **very** interesting.
After a while, I also came across [Octopress](http://octopress.org). That was it. I was sold :)

Free hosting of a blog, no need to maintain a server, and a platform written in [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org)?

Without hesitation, I immediately started working on it. I went through octopress documentation, (which needless to say, but it was fantastic)
found a wonderful theme online at [opthemes](http://opthemes.com), (kudos to [Alex Garibay](http://alexgaribay.com) for that)
and got started. 

And here we are. On a platform that you can hack and customize to your liking - at least more so than the locked down version of wordpress.
On a platform that is written on a language that I don't hate with passion (like cough, **php**, cough), 
and may actually learn in the future, just for the sake of being able to customize every bit of it (gotta love the hacker's way)
- even though I am not really interested in web development per se.

Hope it starts out nice. I guess that is left to be seen.
