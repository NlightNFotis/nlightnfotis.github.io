<h1 id="a-new-beginning">A new beginning</h1>

<p>Oh boy! A new start. Isn’t that exciting? You bet it is. It’s not however
my first introduction to blogging. I used to have a <a href="http://lambdareflection.wordpress.com">blog</a>
on Wordpress.com, but after a while I was turned off by the fact that it felt too limited.
So I decided I wanted a new place for me to host my online presence, that wasn’t so much limited as Wordpress was.
Initially I was thinking about renting a VPS and self hosting wordpress there. But after doing a little research,
I came across <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. I started investigating 
Github pages some more, and found <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> to be very <strong>very</strong> interesting.
After a while, I also came across <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. That was it. I was sold :)</p>

<p>Free hosting of a blog, no need to maintain a server, and a platform written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">ruby</a>?</p>

<p>Without hesitation, I immediately started working on it. I went through octopress documentation, (which needless to say, but it was fantastic)
found a wonderful theme online at <a href="http://opthemes.com">opthemes</a>, (kudos to <a href="http://alexgaribay.com">Alex Garibay</a> for that)
and got started. </p>

<p>And here we are. On a platform that you can hack and customize to your liking - at least more so than the locked down version of wordpress.
On a platform that is written on a language that I don’t hate with passion (like cough, <strong>php</strong>, cough), 
and may actually learn in the future, just for the sake of being able to customize every bit of it (gotta love the hacker’s way)
- even though I am not really interested in web development per se.</p>

<p>Hope it starts out nice. I guess that is left to be seen.</p>
